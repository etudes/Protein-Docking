 ** VERSION HISTORY

 961120 - 0.1  - first version
 961228 - 1.0  - first production version
 990126 - 1.0.1- if rotation file too big, tell the user how much
                 memory should be allocated to it (MASKSIZE)
 010122 - 2.0 - use C routines to do dynamic memory allocation 
                and port to Linux
 040701 -2.0.1- changed checks of dynamic memory allocation to allow
                for pointers with negative values as returned by
                some recent Linux versions
 050622 -2.0.2- increased dimensioning of major arrays in TRACER routine


 ** NOTES

 NOTE: This program is sensitive to the environment variable
       CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable has *not* been set, you will
       not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this happens, the
       program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this,
       put the following line in your .login or .cshrc file:
       setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 ** MAP AND MASK SIZE

 SOLEX allocates memory for maps and masks dynamically.  This means that
   you can increase the size of maps and masks that the program can handle
   on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variables MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (must be
     in capital letters !), for example put the following in your
     .cshrc file:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 setenv MASKSIZE 3000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line arguments MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (need not
     be in capitals), for example:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run solex mapsize 10000000 masksize 5000000 |& tee solex.out
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line arguments take precedence over environment
   variables.  So you can set the environment variables in your .cshrc
   file to "typical" values, and if you have to deal with a map and/or
   mask which is bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument(s).

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 SOLEX needs space for 1 map and 1 mask.

 ** DESCRIPTION

 In the original version of ESSENS, the program could save the best-
   fitting orientation of a search fragment or molecule to a PDB
   file, but extracting the second-best solution etc. was tedious
   to say the least.  In addition, in feature extraction mode, all
   you got was a map showing where helices or strands might fit,
   but the information regarding the best orientation was lost.

 From version 2.0 onwards, ESSENS saves two maps (a "score map" and a
   "display map"), as well as a "rotation file" which contains the
   Euler or polar angles which gave the best fit of the template
   to your electron density.

 This new program SOLEX (SOLution EXtractor) uses these files to
   extract the best solution(s).  For alpha-helices and beta-strands
   it can even attempt to auto-trace (but this is still an experimental
   piece of code !!!).

 ## template PDB file

 Provide the name of the PDB file containing your template or
   (partial) search model.  This must be *exactly* the same PDB file
   as the one you used in the ESSENS calculations !

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Furthest atom (A): (   7.883) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## extraction mode

 Select one of the four possible solution extraction modes.  Note that
   the auto-trace facility is very experimental !

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 SOLEX can extract top solutions in one of 3 modes:
 1 = each to a separate file (e.g., domain)
 2 = all to one file (e.g., ligand)
 3 = try to trace alpha-helices
 4 = try to trace beta-strands
 Solution extraction mode ? (       1) 4
 Solution extraction mode : (       4) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## output PDB file(s)

 For extraction mode 1, provide the basename of the output PDB files
   (e.g., a basename "essens" will give you PDB files which are called
   "essens1.pdb", "essens2.pdb", etc.).

 For the other extraction modes, provide the name of the new PDB file.

 NOTE - For mode 2, you will get multiple copies of the template
   residues with the same residue numbers. A simple way to renumber
   the residues is in O (sam_rename) or MOLEMAN2 (PDb NUmber command) !

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Name for output PDB file ? (solex.pdb) btrace.pdb
 Name for output PDB file : (btrace.pdb) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## output DEJAVU SSE file

 For extraction modes 3 and 4 only, a DEJAVU SSE file will be created.
   This can be used as input to DEJAVU (operating in "Bones search"
   mode) to look for any other proteins in the PDB which have a
   similar set of strands/helices.  If you have run ESSENS/SOLEX
   for both helices and strands, merge the two SSE files before
   running DEJAVU.  See the DEJAVU manual for more details.

 For extraction modes 3 and 4, you may have renamed all but one of
   your CA atoms (e.g., to " CAX") in order to force ESSENS to use
   a particular CA atoms as the pivot point.  SOLEX will rename such
   atoms to " CA ".

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Name for output DEJAVU SSE file ? (beta.sse) beta.sse
 Name for output DEJAVU SSE file : (beta.sse) 

 Renaming " CA?" atoms to " CA " ...
 Removing all but " CA " atoms ...
 Nr of remaining atoms : (       5) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## cut-off score

 Provide the lowest value for acceptable/interesting solutions.  You
   obtain this number for helices/strands by contouring the ESSENS
   "display map" at a level where you can see the strands/helices
   clearly, and not too much (connected) noise.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Cut-off score for top solutions ? (  8.908E+00) 13.0
 Cut-off score for top solutions : (  1.300E+01) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## maximum number of solutions

 Provide the maximum number of solutions you want SOLEX to generate.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Max nr of top solutions ? (      25) 50
 Max nr of top solutions : (      50) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ** OUTPUT

 The output below is for a run in which beta-strands are extracted,
   and where SOLEX tries to trace them.

 First, the top solutions are located:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Could not extend any further
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 This part of the program tries to merge bits of strand/helix that
   are parallel and lie close in space.  Only the CA atoms are retained !

 When it is finished, all stretches which have been extended by at least
   one CA atom are written to the PDB file (with residues renumbered to
   1, 2, 3, ...).  The occupancy of each CA atom is replaced by the
   number of the solution (1, 2, ...), and the B-factor by the score
   of the solution in the "score map" (i.e., higher values, better fits).
   Simultaneously, an SSE file for DEJAVU is created.

 For PDB files created by extraction mode 1 and 2, the occupancy is again
   the number of the solution (but divided by 100), and the B-factor is
   set to: score - average_score / standard_deviation_score (i.e., higher
   numbers mean better fits).

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Nr of stretches left : (      19) 
 Stretch            1 has           12 atoms (solution            2 )
 Stretch            2 has            9 atoms (solution            1 )
 Stretch            3 has            8 atoms (solution            7 )
 Stretch            4 has            8 atoms (solution            9 )
 Stretch            5 has            8 atoms (solution           23 )

 Note that this operation hardly takes any CPU time !  Of course, the
   results are not necessarily fantastic.  We have tested it only with
   20-degree rotation angles so far and what happens is (in the case
   of P2 myelin) is that SOLEX finds large bits of many strands, but
   not all of them run in the correct direction.  So: beware !

 ** WHAT NEXT ?

 For extraction mode 1, read each of the top solutions into O, and judge
   which one (if any) fits your map best.

 For extraction mode 2 (e.g., for ligands, Trp sidechains, etc.), read
   the PDB file into O, draw the solutions and decide which ones to keep.

 For extraction mode 3 and 4, read the PDB file into O, e.g.:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 s_a_i btrace.pdb btra
 mol btra
 paint_ramp atom_b ; red blue
 ca ; end
 bell
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 If you use this way to paint_ramp the molecule, then: the more green/blue
   the CA atoms, the better the fit.

 Of course, you can use the SSE file to do a DEJAVU search (use the
   "Bones search" option).

 ** USING DEJAVU

 You may want to look up the following two references in which the use
   of DEJAVU to work at the level of rough Bones-derived secondary-
   structure elements was first described:

 An SSE file created by SOLEX may look as follows (if you have run ESSENS
   with both strands and helices, you can merge their SSE files of course):

 These 8 beta-strands were extracted from the averaged P2 myelin map.
   Running them through DEJAVU with the suggested "Bones search" settings
   gives one hit if we require that at least 7 strands must match:

 Entry    380 = 1ftp = fatty-acid-binding protein - desert locust (sch
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 This is of course a perfect hit, since FABP and P2 myelin have the same
   fold !  If we relax the search and require only 6 strands to match,
   we get:

 All four hits are correct !  So now all we have to do is to execute the
   O macro produced by DEJAVU, select one of the four PDB entries as our
   starting model, use Mutate_replace a bit, rebuild the model a bit, and
   throw it into X-PLOR !
 (Actually, the orientation of 1CRB is not the correct one, which would
   probably have been avoided if the helices had been used as well.  Also,
   the alignment is very rough, so some rigid-body refinement would be
   necessary in a real-life case !)
