 ** INTRODUCTION

 PROF is a program to calculate electron-density profiles.  It reads
   a library of rigid fragments (e.g., of amino-acid residues), and
   for each fragment finds all copies in your model, retrieves their
   densities, averages them (to yield the "profile map"), and calculates
   how well each copy's density fits the profile map.

 Required input:
 - a map in CCP4 format which covers the entire model
 - your model in PDB format
 - a library file to define the rigid fragments

 Output:
 - a new map in CCP4 format of the profile density
 - a new PDB file of your model, with the B-factors replaced by the
   correlation coefficient of the profile density and the local
   density, multiplied by 100.

 ** RESULTS

 The program lists for each copy of each fragment:
 - correlation coefficient between profile and local density
 - unscaled R-factor between these two densities
 - RMSD for the least-squares superpositioning of the library fragment
   and the copy in your model

 A high correlation coefficient means that the local density is "typical";
   a low correlation coefficient means it is "atypical" (usually, this
   means that the density is very poor).

 A high RMSD means that the geometry of the fragment in your model is
   poor (the library fragments have virtually ideal Engh & Huber geometry).

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 To view the profile map, do the following:
 - mappage the profile map (e.g., with MAPMAN)
 - start up O
 - read the library in as a molecule (sam_atom_in prof.lib prof pdb)
 - draw it and centre on it (mol prof zo ; end ce_zo prof 1 20)
 - draw the profile map at the same level at which you contour the original
   map of your model that went into PROF

 The resulting map shows you what a typical copy of each residue type
   looks like (of course, if your model contains no histidines, there
   will be no density for the histidine in the profile map).  Because
   of the averaging process (unless you have only one copy of a residue
   type in your model), the profile map will usually look better than
   any individual copy.

 To see how well your model fits the profile map, read in the new PDB
   file produced by PROF and colour-ramp it according to B-factor
   (sam_atom_in newfile.pdb new mol new pai_ramp atom_b 0 100 red blue).
   For a good model, one would expect to see a large blue core, with
   some green at the surface and the occasional yellow or red sidechain
   pointing into the solvent.  Out-of-register errors may be detectable
   as continuous regions of green/yellow/red.  Completely "bogus" models
   will have green and blue all over the place (as opposed to a blue
   core with some green on the surface).

 ** LIBRARY

 The default library contains one copy each of the 20 standard amino
   acids, with near-ideal Engh & Huber geometry.  They are arranged
   as two 10-residue beta-strands to make it easy to produce 2D plots.

 The library file is set up such that it can be read into O as a PDB
   file.  The file may contain any number of REMARK records at the
   top.  Fragments are demarcated by PROFIL and ENDPRO records:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
PROFIL ALA (CA) C O
REMARK    2  CA  ALA     1       1.678   1.980  -2.775  1.00 20.00   6
ATOM      3  C   ALA     1       2.837   2.669  -2.062  1.00 20.00   6
ATOM      4  O   ALA     1       4.001   2.456  -2.400  1.00 20.00   8
ENDPRO
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 The PROFIL line contains the name of the fragment (free text).  The atoms
   in each fragment fall into two categories:
 - those that are only needed to do the least-squares superpositioning;
   these are labelled as REMARK records, but have the same format as
   ATOM records (in this way, O will ignore them)
 - those that are used for the superpositioning, but are also to be
   included in the profile calculations; these are given on ordinary
   ATOM records

 Some guidelines for generating your own library entries:
 - each atom should occur on an ATOM record exactly once (it may occur
   on REMARK records more often, or not at all)
 - each fragment should be a rigid entity, i.e. there should be no
   free conformational torsion angle between any of the atoms, both
   those defined with ATOM and those defined with REMARK records
 - each fragment should contain at least two ATOM records (ideally,
   three or more)
 - make sure that all fragments have "ideal" geometry (e.g., Engh & Huber)

 For example, a PHE residue gives rise to three rigid fragments:

 ** PROGRAM DETAILS

 - the output profile map is always on a fixed, orthogonal grid with a
   spacing of 0.5 A in all three directions

 - the "integration radius" for density around any atom is fixed at 1.6 A

 - the algorithm is roughly as follows:
 (1) loop over all groups in the library
 (2) for each group, generate a mask with a radius of 1.6 A around the
     ATOMs on the 0.5 A grid
 (3) loop over all copies of the group in the user's model
 (4) for each copy, retrieve the appropriate atoms; do a least-squares
     superpositioning to get the operator into the user's map; extract
     the density around the copy (using a skew-averaging routine to
     account for the different grids etc.), and accumulate the profile
     density for this group
 (5) average the profile density for this group; accumulate the complete
     profile density map
 (6) loop over all copies of the group again
 (7) for each copy, extract the density again, and calculate the correlation
     coefficient and unscaled R-factor between the local density and the
     profile density; put 100 times the correlation coefficient into the
     B-factor field of each ATOM in this copy of the group
 (8) adjust the complete profile density map (divide each density value
     by the number of times it was set; this is to avoid artefacts due
     to overlap of neighbouring fragments)

 ** MAP AND MASK SIZE

 PROF allocates memory for maps and masks dynamically.  This means that
   you can increase the size of maps and masks that the program can
   handle on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variables MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (must be
     in capital letters !), for example put the following in your
     .cshrc file:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 setenv MASKSIZE 3000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line arguments MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (need not
     be in capitals), for example:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run prof mapsize 10000000 masksize 5000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line arguments take precedence over environment
   variables.  So you can set the environment variables in your .cshrc
   file to "typical" values, and if you have to deal with a map and/or
   mask which is bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument(s).

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 PROF needs space for 2 maps and 1 mask, and for 2 "mini-maps" and
   2 "mini-masks" which are 10% of the size of a normal mask.

 ** NOTES

 PROF is sensitive to the environment variable CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable
   has *not* been set, you will not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this
   happens, the program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this, put the
   following line in your .cshrc file: setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 PROF uses the environment variable GKLIB to set the default location of
   its library file.  If you set GKLIB in your .cshrc file to /nfs/public/lib
   (Uppsala only), the program will always come up with the correct default
   name for this file.

 ** KNOWN BUGS

 None, at present.

 ** UNKNOWN BUGS

 None that I know of ;-)
