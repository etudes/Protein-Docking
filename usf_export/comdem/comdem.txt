                for pointers with negative values as returned by
                some recent Linux versions

 ** MAP SIZE

 From version 2.0 onward, COMDEM allocates memory for its maps
   dynamically.  This means that you can increase the size
   that the program can handle on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variable MAPSIZE (must be in capital
     letters !), for example put the following in your .cshrc file
     or your script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line argument MAPSIZE (need not be in capitals),
     for example in your script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run comdem mapsize 10000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line argument takes precedence over the environment
   variable.  So you can set the environment variable in your .cshrc
   file to a "typical" value, and if you have to deal with maps
   which are bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument.

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 COMDEM needs space for 3 maps.

 ** NOTES

 NOTE: this program is now sensitive to the environment variable
       CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable has *not* been set, you will
       not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this happens, the
       program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this,
       put the following line in your .login or .cshrc file:
       setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 ** DESCRIPTION

 If you want to use multiple-domain averaging, you should
   average and expand your map for each domain separately
   (i.e., with its own mask and set of NCS operators).  Make
   sure that you keep a zero background in the expansion step.

 Then, use this program to combine the individual expanded
   maps and to calculate and set the background level for all
   points not covered by any mask after the maps have been
   combined.

 You may apply different weights to each of the maps, but
   I don't think this is normally necessary (since each map
   is derived from one and the same "master map"), i.e. use
   weights equal to one.

 Note that several statistics are printed: minimum, maximum
   and integrated electron density, the average density, the
   variance (used for scaling) and the standard deviation (the
   square root of the variance).

 In addition, the RMS difference between this map and the
   first one is printed, as is the "shape similarity index"
   (values from -1 to +1; +1 means that the two maps have
   identical shapes, irrespective of the scales they are on).

 NOTE that the correlation coefficient between each of the
      maps MUST be essentially ZERO, since they are supposed
      to cover DISJOINT areas in space !!
      
 If you want to combine more masks, just keep supplying file
   names to the program.  Hit [RETURN] to indicate that there
   are no more maps to be added.

 After all maps have been added, statistics for the combined
   map are printed and you are asked to supply the name of the
   output file:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 New summed CCP4 map ? ( ) zero.E
...
 Map written out
...
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that the "Minimum density in map" is lower than the minimum
   of the two maps.  This is because their masks have a minute overlap,
   and apparently one of the overlapping points gets two negative
   contributions.

 If you want other ways of combining maps (e.g., MAX(map1,map2,...)),
   let me know (or use MAPMAN).

 ** KNOWN BUGS

 None, at present.
