 ** VERSION HISTORY

 970818 - 0.1 - first version
 980909 - 1.0 - added option to merge ANISOUs back in since O
                ignores them at present; serious debugging;
                added occupancy filter and main-chain filter;
                updated this manual and added worked example;
                implemented simple X-PLOR/CNS I/O as well;
                first public release
 990129 -1.0.1- fixed small bug in reading X-PLOR/CNS files (if only
                one residue had an alt. conf., the program refused
                to help you)
 081102 -1.0.3- increased max nr of atoms with alt. conf. to 1 million


 ** INTRODUCTION

 This program converts PDB files containing alternative conformations
   from/to O-style multiple PDB files.  Anisotropic temperature
   factors can also be maintained (not for CNS or X-PLOR files).

 O treats alternative conformations by reading in separate molecules.
   The first should contain all atoms which occur in only one
   conformation, plus the first conformation of those that have
   multiple conformations.  The second file should contain *all*
   atoms of the second conformation of all residues, etc.

 ** PDB to O

 This will work with pure PDB files, as well as those produced by
   TNT, CCP4 (incl. PROLSQ and REFMAC), and SHELX.  It will produce
   multiple PDB files for O.  If at all possible, avoid HETATM
   cards and use ATOM cards for all atoms in the input file (see
   the worked example for the type of problems you may otherwise
   run in to).

 The program reads one residue at a time, and when finished will:
 - write the atoms with blank alternative conformation flag to
   the first O file
 - write the atoms with the first non-blank type of alternative
   conformation flag to the first O file
 - write the atoms with the second type of alternative conformation
   flag to the second O file (together with atoms of this residue
   which occur in only one conformation !)
 - etc. for possible other alternative conformations

 When the entire input file has been processed, alternative
   conformation files to which no atoms have been written will
   automatically be deleted.

 SCALE*, ORIGX*, and CRYST1 cards are echoed to all output PDB
   files; all other non-ATOM|HETATM|ANISOU cards are ignored.

 NOTE that your disordered residues must be numbered sequentially.
   E.g. if you have a loop with two disordered residues, 54 and 55,
   in the PDB file they must come in the order A54, B54, A55, B55.
   (If you have them as A54, A55, B54, B55 it will not work !).

 NOTE that the files with alternative conformations will contain
   ALL atoms of any residue which has an alternative conformation
   for AT LEAST ONE atom !  This is done so that most of the
   standard O tools (which expect all atoms of a residue to be present)
   can be used !  It also means that when the separate files are
   merged back into one big file, such atoms have to be removed
   again (see "O to PDB" below) !

 NOTE also that NO alternative conformation flags are used in the
   separate files produced by ACONIO.  This is because O does not
   like them (it appends them to the atom name if possible) and
   gets terribly confused !

 ** CNS to O

 This converts PDB files produced by CNS or X-PLOR.  Since these programs
   use the SEGIDs to flag alternative conformations, the program needs
   some help (otherwise, it wouldn't know if a different SEGID signifies
   a hetero-compound, an NCS-related molecule, or an alternative
   conformation).  SEGIDs are case-sensitive, and make sure that any
   spaces are in the correct position (e.g., a leading space in " AC1").

 NOTE that the files with alternative conformations will contain
   ALL atoms of any residue which has an alternative conformation
   for AT LEAST ONE atom !  This is done so that most of the
   standard O tools (which expect all atoms of a residue to be present)
   can be used !  It also means that when the separate files are
   merged back into one big file, such atoms have to be removed
   again (see "O to PDB" below) !

 ** O to PDB

 This will generate a single PDB file that ought to be compatible
   with the PDB format, TNT, CCP4 (incl. PROLSQ and REFMAC), and SHELX.

 The program will first read all the files containing alternative
   conformations, and store all atoms found in them (while assigning
   them alt. conf. markers as provided by the user, usually B, C, ..).

 Subsequently, the program will process the main PDB file.  For every
   atom it will check the set of alt. conf. atoms to find its mates
   (these must have the same atom name, column 13-16, and the same
   residue name and type, column 18-27).  However, since O required
   complete residues, some of the atoms in alt. conf. file(s) may
   not represent alt. conf. at all (see "PDB to O" above).  In order
   to try and figure out if an atom is simply a duplicate of a
   main-conformation atom, or whether it is a genuine alt. conf. atom,
   three heuristics can be used:

 - main-chain filter: if your alt. confs. are limited to side-chain
   atoms, then it must mean that all main-chain atoms in the alt.
   conf. files can safely be ignored

 - occupancy filter: if the main-conformation atom has an occupancy
   greater than, say, 0.99, its mates in alt. confs. can be ignored

 - distance filter: if an alt. conf. atom is very close to its
   main-conformation mate it can perhaps be ignored

 Usually, the occupancy filter is the simplest and safest to use.
   You will be asked if you want to use the main-chain filter.
   If you want to use the occupancy filter, use a cut-off of, say,
   0.99.  If you do NOT want to use it, use a cut-off greater
   than 1.0.  If you want to use the distance filter, use a safe
   value (e.g., 0.01 A); if you don't want to use it, use a value
   less than 0.0 A.

 All cases where duplicate atoms occur wil be listed by the programme,
   and the reason for ignoring or accepting the alt. confs. will be
   printed as well.  If an atom has (apparently) genuine alt. confs.,
   the main conformation will get an alt. conf. indicator (usually, A),
   and all of them will be written to the output PDB file.

 Any "orphaned" alt. conf. atoms (i.e., present in one of the
   alt. conf. file, but not in the main file) will be listed at
   the end (there shouldn't be any !).

 ** Salvage ANISOU cards

 Since at present O ignores anisotropic temperature factor cards,
   the output PDB files from O will not contain these records.
   This option provides a quick-and-dirty way to salvage the
   ANISOU cards by stealing them from an older PDB file of your
   model.  The only prerequisite is that the names and order of
   the ATOMs and HETATMs is exactly the same in both PDB files.

 Now you can rebuild your molecule (and the residues with alternative

   real-space refinement, etc.)

 When you're done, write out the modified molecules:

 (3) Merge the various PDB files into one file again

 Since there are a few residues with alternative main-chain conformations,
   we cannot use the main-chain filter.  So, we will use the occupancy
   filter to remove atoms without real alternative conformations.

 The OE2 atoms are sorted B-A here, which confuses ACONIO since it
  expects the same order as in our file "m2.pdb", which is A-B.
  So, edit the file 1ctj.pdb to reverse the order and run again:

 This problem has to do with the fact that O doesn't like HETATM cards
   (it writes them out as ATOM cards and uses a "$" sign as the chain
   identifier).  However, the output file "m2u.pdb" contains all of
   the protein, and the rest can be added either by cut-and-paste,
   or by renaming the HETATMs to ATOMs in 1ctj.pdb, and replacing the
   "$" signs by spaces in m2.pdb and re-running ACONIO.  However,
   normally I suspect all your HETATMs will be called ATOMs to
   begin with, so this problem wouldn't arise in the first place.

 The output PDB file should start like this approximately:
