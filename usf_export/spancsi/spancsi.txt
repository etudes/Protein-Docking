 ** VERSION HISTORY

 970522 - 0.1 - first version (options A and C)
 970523 - 0.2 - added option B
 010122 - 1.0 - use C routines to do dynamic memory allocation 
                and port to Linux
 040701 -1.0.1- changed checks of dynamic memory allocation to allow
                for pointers with negative values as returned by
                some recent Linux versions
 080625 -1.0.2- suppress error messages if more than 10 of them

 ** MAP AND MASK SIZE

 SPANCSI allocates memory for maps and masks dynamically.  This means that
   you can increase the size of maps and masks that the program can handle
   on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variables MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (must be
     in capital letters !), for example put the following in your
     .cshrc file or your RAVE script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 setenv MASKSIZE 3000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line arguments MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (need not
     be in capitals), for example in your RAVE script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run spancsi -b mapsize 10000000 masksize 5000000 < spancsi.inp >& spancsi.out
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line arguments take precedence over environment
   variables.  So you can set the environment variables in your .cshrc
   file to "typical" values, and if you have to deal with a map and/or
   mask which is bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument(s).

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something like 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 SPANCSI needs space for 3 maps and 1 mask.

 ** PURPOSE

 SPANCSI can be useful if you have indications that (of want
   to investigate if) your NCS-related molecules have very
   different average temperature factors, for example due to
   differences in the packing.  For example, in the structure
   of P2 myelin protein (PDB code 1PMP), molecule "C" has
   a considerably higher average temperature factor than the
   other two molecules, "A" and "B".  This is visible in the
   skeletons, but was also verified using Rfree by refining
   an overall B-factor shift for each of the three molecules
   with X-PLOR.  R and Rfree both dropped, and the average
   B-factor for the "C" molecule ended up being ~10 \A**2
   higher than those of the other two molecules.

 SPANCSI allows you to:

 - calculate density statistics for each of your NCS-related
   molecules separately

 - calculate correlation coefficients etc. for each pair of
   NCS-related molecules

 - average and expand density using variance weighting for
   each of the NCS-related molecules.  For example, suppose
   you have two molecules for which the variance of the
   molecular density is 100 and 50, respectively.  Now in
   the averaging, the contribution of the second molecule
   will be upweighted by a factor of 100/50 = 2.0, and
   when the averaged density is expanded back into the unit
   cell or asymmetric unit, the density for the second
   molecule will be downweighted by a factor of 50/100 = 0.5.
   This hopefully leads to better convergence and better
   phases and maps.

 If you find that there are differences between the molecules,
   change your averaging script so it uses SPANCSI instead of AVE.

 ** NOTES

 NOTE: this program is sensitive to the environment variable
       CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable has *not* been set, you will
       not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this happens, the
       program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this,
       put the following line in your .login or .cshrc file:
       setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 NOTE: this program is sensitive to the environment variable OSYM.
   It should point to your local copy of $ODAT/symm, the directory
   which contains the spacegroup symmetry operators in O format.
   When asked for a file with spacegroup operators in O format,
   you may either provide a filename, or the name of a sapcegroup
   (including blanks if you like, case doesn't matter).  The program
   will try to open the following files, assuming that STRING is the
   what you input:
 (1) open a file called STRING
 (2) if this fails, check if OSYM is defined and open $OSYM/STRING
 (3) if this fails, open $OSYM/string.sym
 (4) if this fails, open $OSYM/string.o
 Hint: if you make soft links in the OSYM directory, you can also type
   spacegroup numbers (e.g.: \ln -s p212121.sym 19.sym).

 NOTE: you may choose to enter NCS operators
       either one by one, or all in one go (by
       putting them all in one file), or a mixture of this.

 ** EXAMPLE

 The input consists of:
 - name of the input map (CCP4 format)
 - name of the mask file (any MAMA format)
 - name of the output map (only if the program is used for doing
   variance-scaled averaging and expansion)
 - spacegroup symmetry operators (O format)
 - file(s) with NCS operators (O format; include the unit operator;
   signal end of input by an empty line)

 The use of the program is demonstrated using the unaveraged
   MIR map (2.7 \A) of P2 myelin protein:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Select one of the following options:
  
 A = Analyse density for individual NCS molecules
 C = Correlate density for pairs of NCS molecules
 B = Both average and expand using variance scaling
 Q = Quit this program

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 The result for option A (note that the variance for the third, "C"
   molecule is quite a bit lower than that for the other two molecules):

 ** ERRORS

 - if you get "severe FRCSYM errors" during the averaging
   step, your map probably does not encompass N asymmetric
   units PLUS ONE POINT ON ALL SIDES

 - if you get "interpolation errors" during the expansion
   step, your mask probably extends too close to the
   border(s) of its grid (use MAMA to test and remedy this)


 ** KNOWN BUGS

 None, at present.
