                for pointers with negative values as returned by
                some recent Linux versions

 ** MAP SIZE

 From version 2.0 onward, COMAP allocates memory for its maps
   dynamically.  This means that you can increase the size
   that the program can handle on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variable MAPSIZE (must be in capital
     letters !), for example put the following in your .cshrc file
     or your script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line argument MAPSIZE (need not be in capitals),
     for example in your script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run comap mapsize 10000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line argument takes precedence over the environment
   variable.  So you can set the environment variable in your .cshrc
   file to a "typical" value, and if you have to deal with maps
   which are bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument.

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 COMAP needs space for 3 maps.

 ** NOTES

 NOTE: this program is now sensitive to the environment variable
       CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable has *not* been set, you will
       not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this happens, the
       program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this,
       put the following line in your .login or .cshrc file:
       setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 ** DESCRIPTION

 With COMAP you can combine and scale various maps to
   produce a weighted, averaged map.  COMAP is a more
   general version of Alwyn's map_add program.

 COMAP allows you to combine ANY number of maps,
   provided all have the same grid, origin, extent and
   unit cells (within 0.01 A or degree).  The final
   map contains the following density:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Ecombi (x,y,z) = W * SUM (weight(i)*scale(i)*map(i)(x,y,z))
                      i=1,
                      NMAP

 - weight (i) = weight for map nr I, defined by the user

              / 1.0,           if I = 1
 - scale (i) = 
              \ VAR(1)/VAR(I), if I > 1 (VAR = variance of the map)

 - W = 1.0 / (SUM (weight(i)*scale(i)))
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that by clever choices of the weights, COMAP can be
   used to add or subtract maps.  The scale factors are
   computed by the program and will ensure that (if the Fobs
   used to produce the maps have been scaled appropriately)
   the individual maps are scaled together properly.

 ** EXAMPLE

 The following example shows how to add two maps
   with weights 1.0 and 2.0:

 Start the program and provide the name of the first map
   and its weight:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
...
 Reference map : av_0.E
...
 Map nr   1      Size     352000
 ED min, max, total  -6.2134E+01  9.3133E+01  2.6856E+00
 ED ave, var, stdev   7.6294E-06  1.9540E+02  1.3978E+01

 Scale  : (   1.000)
 Weight ? (   1.000) 1
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Now give the name of the second file and its weight:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Map nr : (       2)
 Map b: scr.E
   Read header.
...
 Map nr   2      Size     352000
 ED min, max, total  -3.6909E+02  5.0000E+02  2.4826E-02
 ED ave, var, stdev   7.0529E-08  6.0782E+03  7.7963E+01

 Scale  : (   0.032)
 Weight ? (   1.000) 2.0
 Multiplier : (  6.429E-02)
 RMSD map A / B : (  6.676E+01)
 Shape similarity A / B : (   0.834)
 Busy ...
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that several statistics are printed: minimum, maximum
   and integrated electron density, the average density, the
   variance (used for scaling) and the standard deviation (the
   square root of the variance).

 In addition, the RMS difference between this map and the
   first one is printed, as is the "shape similarity index"
   (values from -1 to +1; +1 means that the two maps have
   identical shapes, irrespective of the scales they are on).

 If you want to combine more masks, just keep supplying file
   names to the program.  Hit [RETURN] to indicate that there
   are no more maps to be added.

 Note that COMAP actually checks if the maps are on the same
   grid etc. as the first one:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Map nr : (       3)
 Map b: av_2x.E
   Read header.
...
   Map read OK.
 Grid   : (        100         110          64)
 Origin : (         31          45           8)
 Extent : (         48          53          61)
 Cell   : (  91.800   99.500   56.500   90.000   90.000   90.000)
 ERROR --- Different origin, extent, grid, cell
 ERROR --- This map will NOT be added

 Map nr : (       3)
 Map b:
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 After all maps have been added, statistics for the combined
   map are printed and you are asked to supply the name of the
   output file:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Map nr : (       3)
 Map b:
 No more maps to add

 Sum of weights and scales : (  1.064E+00)
 Map nr   0      Size     352000
 ED min, max, total  -7.7514E+01  1.1771E+02  9.8195E-01
 ED ave, var, stdev   2.7896E-06  2.9797E+02  1.7262E+01

 New summed CCP4 map: sum.E

   Map written out.
