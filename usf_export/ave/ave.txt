 ** MAP AND MASK SIZE

 From version 4.0 onward, AVE allocates memory for maps and
   masks dynamically.  This means that you can increase the size
   of maps and masks that the program can handle on the fly:

 1 - through the environment variables MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (must be
     in capital letters !), for example put the following in your
     .cshrc file or your RAVE script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 setenv MAPSIZE 8000000
 setenv MASKSIZE 3000000
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 2 - by using command-line arguments MAPSIZE and MASKSIZE (need not
     be in capitals), for example in your RAVE script:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 run ave -b mapsize 10000000 masksize 5000000 < ave.inp >& ave.out
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 Note that command-line arguments take precedence over environment
   variables.  So you can set the environment variables in your .cshrc
   file to "typical" values, and if you have to deal with a map and/or
   mask which is bigger than that, you can use the command-line argument(s).

 If sufficient memory cannot be allocated, the program will print
   a message and quit.  In that case, increase the amount of virtual
   memory (this will not help, of course, if you try to allocate more
   memory than can be addressed by your machine (for 32-bit machines,
   something 2**32-1 bytes, I think), or reduce the size requirements.

 AVE needs space for 2 maps and 1 mask.

 ** NOTES

 NOTE: this program is now sensitive to the environment variable
       CCP4_OPEN.  If this variable has *not* been set, you will
       not be able to create any CCP4 maps.  If this happens, the
       program will abort execution on startup.  To fix this,
       put the following line in your .login or .cshrc file:
       setenv CCP4_OPEN UNKNOWN

 NOTE: this program is sensitive to the environment variable OSYM.
   It should point to your local copy of $ODAT/symm, the directory
   which contains the spacegroup symmetry operators in O format.
   When asked for a file with spacegroup operators in O format,
   you may either provide a filename, or the name of a sapcegroup
   (including blanks if you like, case doesn't matter).  The program
   will try to open the following files, assuming that STRING is the
   what you input:
 (1) open a file called STRING
 (2) if this fails, check if OSYM is defined and open $OSYM/STRING
 (3) if this fails, open $OSYM/string.sym
 (4) if this fails, open $OSYM/string.o
 Hint: if you make soft links in the OSYM directory, you can also type
   spacegroup numbers (e.g.: \ln -s p212121.sym 19.sym).

 NOTE: from version 3.3 onwards, you may choose to enter NCS operators
       either one by one (as it used to be), or all in one go (by
       putting them all in one file), or a mixtur of this.

 NOTE: THIS IS BASICALLY A NEW VERSION OF ALWYN'S OLD
       es_average PROGRAM.

 NOTE: from version 1.2 onwards the input has changed
       since you can now run average and expand separately.
       THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO CHANGE OLD COMMAND FILES !!!

 You may use this program to:
 - average density onto a mask
 - expand density into an asymmetric unit or unit cell
 - do both in one go (usual m.o.)

 These two steps need to be separated if yoy want to employ
   proper symmetry.  For example, you have a tetramer with
   proper 222 symmetry; in that case proceed as follows:
 - make a mask around the whole tetramer
 - average with this mask and the four NCS operators
 - expand with ONLY the unit NCS operator

 ** INPUT

 Input items:

 task = both
 unaveraged map
 mask file
 output averaged & expanded map
 spacegroup symmetry operators
 NCS operators

 task = average
 unaveraged map
 mask file
 output averaged map
 spacegroup symmetry operators
 NCS operators

 task = expand
 example map (comprising one ASU or unit cell)
 mask file
 averaged map (on the same grid as the mask)
 output expanded map (same grid as example map)
 spacegroup symmetry operators
 NCS operators

 NOTES:
 - all maps are in CCP4 binary format
 - masks may come in any format supported by MAMA
 - spacegroup symmetry and NCS operators should be
   provided as "O" datablock files
 - the NCS operators would normally explicitly
   include the UNIT OPERATOR !
 - signal the end of the NCS input by an empty line

 ** ERRORS

 - if you get "severe FRCSYM errors" during the averaging
   step, your map probably does not encompass N asymmetric
   units PLUS ONE POINT ON ALL SIDES

 - if you get "interpolation errors" during the expansion
   step, your mask probably extends too close to the
   border(s) of its grid (use MAMA to test and remedy this)

 ** UPDATES

 ## Version 3.0

 You are now presented with the following options on startup:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Which task ?
  A = Average (normal)
  E = Expand (normal)
  B = Both average and expand (normal)
  Q = Quit right now
  T = Test interpolation
  P = Average; enforce positivity
  R = Average and expand; enforce positivity
  X = Expand; keep zero background
  Y = Average and expand; keep zero background
  Z = Average and expand; zero back; positivity
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 If you want, you may enforce positivity of the density inside
   the mask.  In this case, all mask points which receive an
   average density <= zero will be set to an arbitrary small
   positive value instead.

 In addition, you can now use AVE to do multiple domain NCS
   averaging.  For example, if you have a hetero-dimer in
   which each monomer has its own mask and NCS operators,
   you could proceed as follows:

 * calculate a map
 * for each domain, average and expand, BUT keep the
   background density at zero (e.g. with option Y or Z)
 * combine the individual expanded map with COMDEM
   (NOT with COMAP); this will add all contributions
   together and afterwards calculate the average background
   density to which all the points which were still at
   zero will be set
 * calculate structure factors, scale them against Fobs and
   calculate a new map
 * average and expand each domain separately again, etc.

 ## Version 3.4

 A new option has been implemented, namely mask-less averaging.
   This can be used when the boundaries of your molecule are not
   clear yet (i.e., the extent of the cell where the local
   (NCS) symmetery operators apply).  Probably the way to use
   it is:
 - provide a map around your N-mer (e.g., tetramer)
 - run one cycle of mask-less averaging (without expansion !)
 - check where in the map density survives and where it doesn't
 
 With improper NCS, only density for one molecule should remain;
   with proper NCS the boundaries of the whole N-mer should become
   visible.  In the latter case, you can then either use a mask
   which covers the entire N-mer, or a mask which covers an
   *arbitrary* 1/N-th of the complete N-mer.  However, beware
   that "proper" symmetry can sometimes be a trifle improper
   (e.g., a 222 tetramer with small translational components);
   in such a case, the assumptions break down.  In general, it
   is therefore safest to assume improper symmetry in all cases
   (my humble opinion).

 With mask-less averaging, the major loop is not over mask points, but
   over points in your asymmetric unit or unit cell.  For each point,
   all NCS operators are applied, and the density is averaged.  This
   means that there are no separate averaging and expansion steps !
 The input to the program is the same as usual, except that you don't
   need to supply a mask file (obviously).

 ** KNOWN BUGS

 None, at present.
