# Description:
Carglumic acid is an orphan drug used for the treatment of hyperammonaemia in patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. This rare genetic disorder results in elevated blood levels of ammonia, which can eventually cross the blood–brain barrier and cause neurologic problems, cerebral edema, coma, and death. Carglumic acid was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 18 March 2010.

# InChI_Key:
InChIKey=LCQLHJZYVOQKHU-VKHMYHEASA-N

# Indication:
For the treatment of acute and chronic hyperammonaemia in patients with N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency. This enzyme is an important component of the urea cycle to prevent build up of neurotoxic ammonium in the blood.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C05829

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D07130

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
6781

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG), which is an essential allosteric activator of the liver enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). CPS1 is found in the mitochondria and is the first enzyme of the urea cycle, which converts ammonia into urea. Carglumic acid acts as a replacement for NAG in NAGS deficiency patients by activating CPS1 but it does not help to regulate the urea cycle.
