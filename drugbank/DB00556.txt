# Description:
Perflutren, a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement during the indicated echocardiographic procedures, is comprised of lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane(OFP) gas. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and "echo" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients.

# Drug_Interactions:
Artemether	Additive QTc-prolongation may occur. Concomitant therapy should be avoided.
Lumefantrine	Additive QTc-prolongation may occur. Concomitant therapy should be avoided.
Tacrolimus	Additive QTc-prolongation may occur increasing the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Concomitant therapy should be used with caution.
Thiothixene	May cause additive QTc-prolonging effects. Increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Consider alternate therapy. Thorough risk:benefit assessment is required prior to co-administration.
Toremifene	Additive QTc-prolongation may occur, increasing the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Consider alternate therapy. A thorough risk:benefit assessment is required prior to co-administration.
Trimipramine	Additive QTc-prolongation may occur, increasing the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Concomitant therapy should be used with caution.
Voriconazole	Additive QTc prolongation may occur. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for QTc prolongation as this can lead to Torsade de Pointes (TdP).
Vorinostat	Additive QTc prolongation may occur. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for QTc prolongation as this can lead to Torsade de Pointes (TdP).
Ziprasidone	Additive QTc-prolonging effects may increase the risk of severe arrhythmias. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Zuclopenthixol	Additive QTc prolongation may occur. Consider alternate therapy or use caution and monitor for QTc prolongation as this can lead to Torsade de Pointes (TdP).

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Perflutren is comprised of gas-filled microspheres that are injected or infused into the body. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and "echo" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients.

# Pharmacology:
Perflutren, a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement during the indicated echocardiographic procedures, comprised of lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane(OFP) gas. It provide contrast enhancement of the endocardial borders during echocardiography. The perflutren lipid microspheres exhibit lower acoustic impedance than blood and enhance the intrinsic backscatter of blood.
