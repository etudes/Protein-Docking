# Pharmacology:
5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine, also known as 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, 5-MeO-DiPT, foxy methoxy, or just foxy, is a tryptamine that is used recreationally as a psychedelic. 5-MeO-DiPT is orally active, and dosages between 6–20 mg are commonly reported. Many users note an unpleasant body load accompanies higher dosages. 5-MeO-DiPT is also taken by insufflation, or sometimes it is smoked or injected. Some users also report sound distortion, also noted with the related drug, DiPT.
