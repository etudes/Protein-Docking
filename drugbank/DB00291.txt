# Description:
A nitrogen mustard alkylating agent used as antineoplastic agent for the treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Although it is less toxic than most other nitrogen mustards, it has been listed as a known carcinogen in the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (Merck Index, 11th ed)

# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Antineoplastic Agents
Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating

# Drug_Interactions:
Bendamustine	Increases toxicity through pharmacodynamic synergism. Additive myelosuppression.
Leflunomide	Immunosuppressants such as chlorambucil may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of leflunomide. Specifically, the risk for hematologic toxicity such as pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and/or thrombocytopenia may be increased. Consider eliminating the use of a leflunomide loading dose in patients who are receiving other immunosuppressants in order to reduce the risk for serious adverse events such as hematologic toxicity. Also, patients receiving both leflunomide and another immunosuppressive medication should be monitored for bone marrow suppression at least monthly throughout the duration of concurrent therapy.
Natalizumab	Immunosuppressants such as chlorambucil may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of natalizumab. Specifically, the risk of concurrent infection may be increased. Patients receiving natalizumab should not use concurrent immunosuppressants.
Pimecrolimus	Pimecrolimus may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of immunosuppressants such as chlorambucil. Avoid use of pimecrolimus cream in patients receiving immunosuppressants.
Roflumilast	Roflumilast may enhance the immunosuppressive effect of immunosuppressants such as chlorambucil. The Canadian roflumilast product monograph recommends avoiding concurrent use of roflumilast with any immunosuppressant medications due to the antiinflammatory/immune altering effects of roflumilast and the lack of relevant clinical experience with such use. Of note, this recommendation to avoid concurrent use does not apply to either inhaled corticosteroids (which have much more limited systemic immune-suppressing actions) or short-term systemic corticosteroid use. U.S. prescribing information does not contain this warning; but it appears prudent to avoid this combination when possible.
Tacrolimus	Tacrolimus (Topical) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of immunosuppressants sucb as chlorambucil. Avoid use of tacrolimus ointment in patients receiving immunosuppressants.
Trastuzumab	Trastuzumab may increase the risk of neutropenia and anemia. Monitor closely for signs and symptoms of adverse events.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations.

# Pharmacology:
Chlorambucil is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents that is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.

DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
