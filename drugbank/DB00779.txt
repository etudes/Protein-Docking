# AHFS_Codes:
08:12.18

# ATC_Codes:
J01MB02

# Absorption:
Following oral administration, nalidixic acid is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability is approximately 96%. Absorption may be delayed if taken with antacids.

# Biotransformation:
Hepatic. 30% of administered dose is metabolized to the active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid. Rapid conjugation of parent drug and active metabolite to inactive metabolites. Metabolism may vary widely among individuals. In the urine, hydroxynalidixic acid represents 80 to 85% of the antibacterial activity.

# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Anti-Infective Agents
Enzyme Inhibitors
Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors

# Drug_Interactions:
Acenocoumarol	The quinolone antibiotic, nalidixic acid, may increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol.
Anisindione	The quinolone antibiotic, nalidixic acid, may increase the anticoagulant effect of anisindione.
Calcium Acetate	Calcium salts such as calcium acetate may decrease the absorption of quinolone antibiotics such as nalidixic acid. Of concern only with oral administration of both agents. Interactions can be minimized by administering oral quinolone at least 2 hours before, or 6 hours after, the dose of an oral calcium supplement. Monitor for decreased therapeutic effects of oral quinolones if administered with oral calcium supplements.
Dicumarol	The quinolone antibiotic, nalidixic acid, may increase the anticoagulant effect of dicumarol.
Warfarin	The quinolone antibiotic, nalidixic acid, may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

# Pharmacology:
Nalidixic acid is a quinolone antibacterial agent for oral administration. Nalidixic acid has marked antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria including <i>Enterobacter</i> species, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Morganella Morganii</i>; <i>Proteus Mirabilis</i>, <i>Proteus vulgaris</i>, and <i>Providencia rettgeri</i>. <i>Pseudomonas</i> species are generally resistant to the drug. Nalidixic acid is bactericidal and is effective over the entire urinary pH range. Conventional chromosomal resistance to nalidixic acid taken in full dosage has been reported to emerge in approximately 2 to 14 percent of patients during treatment; however, bacterial resistance to nalidixic acid has not been shown to be transferable via R factor.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
