# Description:
Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt used as an antacid. It is a basic compound that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Subsequent increases in pH may inhibit the action of pepsin. An increase in bicarbonate ions and prostaglandins may also confer cytoprotective effects. Calcium carbonate may also be used as a nutritional supplement or to treat hypocalcemia.

# Drug_Category:
Antacids

# Drug_Interactions:
Calcium Acetate	Calcium salts may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of calcium acetate. Concurrent use of other calcium salts with calcium acetate should be avoided when possible. This combination is particularly dangerous in patients with other risk factors for hypercalcemia, such as those with end-stage renal disease.
Calcium Chloride	Calcium salts may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of calcium chloride. Concurrent use of other calcium salts with calcium acetate should be avoided when possible. This combination is particularly dangerous in patients with other risk factors for hypercalcemia, such as those with end-stage renal disease.
Eltrombopag	Decreases levels of eltrombopag by GI absorption inhibition.
Itraconazole	The antacid, calcium carbonate, may decrease the effect of itraconazole by decreasing its absorption.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Calcium carbonate is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption. Cytoprotective effects may occur through increases in bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and prostaglandins. Neutralization of hydrochloric acid results in the formation of calcium chloride, carbon dioxide and water. Approximately 90% of calcium chloride is converted to insoluble calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate).

# Pharmacology:
Gastric-peptic disease occurs as a result of an imbalance between protective factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and prostaglandin secretion, and aggressive factors, such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>). Antacids work by restoring acid-base balance, attenuating the pepsin activity and increasing bicarbonate and prostaglandin secretion. The acid-neutralizing capacity of calcium carbonate is 58 mEq/15 ml. 
When used as a nutritional supplement, calcium carbonate acts by directly increasing calcium stores within the body.
