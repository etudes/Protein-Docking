# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus. Genetic studies suggest that a virus protein specified by the virion M2 gene plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine.

# Pharmacology:
Rimantadine, a cyclic amine, is a synthetic antiviral drug and a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug amantadine. Rimantadine is inhibitory to the in vitro replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the three antigenic subtypes (H1N1, H2H2 and H3N2) that have been isolated from man. Rimantadine has little or no activity against influenza B virus. Rimantadine does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A vaccine.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
Forms a highly low-pH gated proton-selective channel. When the environmental pH is lower than a threshold, the M2 channel is activated and selectively transports protons across the membrane from the extracellular side to the cytoplasmic side. Crucial for the uncoating process. When the virion is internalized into the endosome, the channel acidifies the virion's interior, promoting the dissociation of matrix protein 1 (M1) from the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) thus allowing the transport of the RNP from the virion into the cell's nucleus. Also plays a role in viral proteins secretory pathway. Elevates the intravesicular pH of normally acidic compartments, such as trans-Golgi network, preventing newly formed hemagglutinin from premature switching to the fusion-active conformation
