# AHFS_Codes:
08:12.28.28

# ATC_Codes:
A07AA10
J01XB01

# Absorption:
Very poor absorption from gastrointestinal tract.

# Biotransformation:
As 80% of the dose can be recovered unchanged in the urine, and there is no biliary excretion, it can be assumed that the remaining drug is inactivated in the tissues, however the mechanism is unknown.

# Description:
Cyclic polypeptide antibiotic from Bacillus colistinus. It is composed of Polymyxins E1 and E2 (or Colistins A, B, and C) which act as detergents on cell membranes. Colistin is less toxic than Polymyxin B, but otherwise similar; the methanesulfonate is used orally. [PubChem]

# InChI_Key:

# Indication:
For the treatment of acute or chronic infections due to sensitive strains of certain gram-negative bacilli, particularly <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C13768

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D02138

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
803

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Colistin is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes.

# Pharmacology:
Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic agent. Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. With the development of less toxic agents, such as extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, parenteral polymyxin use was largely abandoned, except for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. More recently, however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and the lack of new antimicrobial agents have led to the revived use of the polymyxins.

# Toxicity:
Oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 5450 mg/kg. Overdosage with colistimethate can cause neuromuscular blockade characterized by paresthesia, lethargy, confusion, dizziness, ataxia, nystagmus, disorders of speech and apnea. Respiratory muscle paralysis may lead to apnea, respiratory arrest and death.
