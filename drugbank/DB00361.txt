# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinorelbine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Like other vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.

# Pharmacology:
Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent used as a treatment for various cancers including breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, and testicular cancer. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects <i>in vitro</i>. Vinorelbine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Vinorelbine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific.
