# InChI_Key:
InChIKey=CFCUWKMKBJTWLW-BKHRDMLASA-N

# Indication:
For the treatment of testicular cancer, as well as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria associated with a variety of advanced forms of cancer.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C12389

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D00468

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
6816

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Plicamycin is presumed to inhibit cellular and enzymic RNA synthesis by forming a complex with DNA. Plicamycin may also lower calcium serum levels by inhibiting the effect of parathyroid hormone upon osteoclasts or by blocking the hypercalcemic action of pharmacologic doses of vitamin D.

# Toxicity:
The most important form of toxicity associated with the use of plicamycin consists of a dose-related bleeding syndrome which usually begins with an episode of epistaxis. Plicamycin crosses the blood-brain barrier; the concentration found in brain tissue is low but it persists longer than in other tissues.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
