# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Crotamiton is an antiparasitic that is toxic to the scabies mite. Crotamiton also relieves itching by producing what is called a counter-irritation. As crotamiton evaporates from the skin, it produces a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to divert your body's attention away from the itching.

# Pharmacology:
Crotamiton is usually used to treat pruritis (itching of the skin) caused by scabies or sunburn. Crotamiton relieves itching by producing what is called a counter-irritation. As crotamiton evaporates from the skin, it produces a cooling effect. This cooling effect helps to divert your body's attention away from the itching. Due to this cooling effect it is also effective for the relief of sunburn. The drug is also believed to kill scabies through an unknown mechanism.
