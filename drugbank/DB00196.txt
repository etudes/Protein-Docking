# LIMS_Drug_ID:
196

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Fluconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Fluconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis.

# Pharmacology:
Fluconazole, a synthetic antifungal agent of the imidazole class, is used to treat vaginal candidiasis. It inhibits the fungal lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase which thereby prevents the formation of ergosterol which is an essential component in the fungal cell membrane.

# Drug_Target_1_Reaction:
obtusifoliol + 3 O2 + 3 NADPH + 3 H+ = 4alpha-methyl-5alpha-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien-3beta-ol + formate + 3 NADP+ + 4 H2O

# Drug_Target_1_Signals:
None

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
Catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. It transforms lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol
