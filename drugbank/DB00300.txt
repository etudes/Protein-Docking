# Description:
Tenofovir, marketed by Gilead Sciences under the trade name Viread&reg;, belongs to a class of antiretroviral drugs known as nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs), which block reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial to viral production in HIV-infected people. [Wikipedia]

# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Anti-HIV Agents
Nucleoside and Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors

# Drug_Interactions:
Atazanavir	Concomitant therapy may result in decreased serum levels of Atazanavir and increased levels of Tenofovir. Concomitant therapy should only be used with the inclusion of Ritonavir.
Didanosine	Tenofovir may decrease the therapeutic effects and increase the adverse effects of Didanosine. Monitor for changes in virologic response and Didanosine toxicity during concomitant therapy.
Valganciclovir	The excretion rates of Valganciclovir and/or Tenofovir may decrease as both drugs are eliminated by active tubular secretion. Monitor for increased serum concentrations and toxicity of both agents.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Tenofovir inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5&rsquo;-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Specifically, the drugs are analogues of the naturally occurring deoxynucleotides  needed to synthesize the viral DNA and they compete with the natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. However, unlike the natural deoxynucleotides substrates, NRTIs and NtRTIs (nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors) lack a 3'-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. As a result, following incorporation of an NRTI or an NtRTI, the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the next 5'-3' phosphodiester  bond needed to extend the DNA chain. Thus, when an NRTI or NtRTI is incorporated, viral DNA synthesis is halted, a process known as chain termination. All NRTIs and NtRTIs are classified as competitive substrate inhibitors.

# Pharmacology:
Tenofovir belongs to a class of antiretroviral drugs known as nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), which block reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial to viral production in HIV-infected people. Tenofovir is currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis B. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate. Tenofovir requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases &alpha;, &beta;, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase &gamma;.

DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
