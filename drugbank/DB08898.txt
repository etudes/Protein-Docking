# Description:
Glucarpidase is the recombinant form of the enzyme carboxypeptidase that is produced in Esherichia coli. In patients, glucarpidase inactivates methotrexate, and other antifolates, by hydrolyzing glutamate on the carboxyl terminal of these compounds. Therefore since methotrexate is elminated enzymatically and not by the kidneys, glucarpidase is indicated in patients on methotrexate treatment who have kidney dysfunction, and are experiencing an abnormally high plasma concentration of methotrexate (>1 micromole per liter). Glucarpidase is marketed under the brand name Voraxaze®.

# Dosage_Forms:
Injection, powder, lyophilized, for solution	Intravenous

# Drug_Category:
Antidotes
Enzyme

# Drug_Interactions:
Leucovorin	Do not administer leucovorin within 2 hours of glucarpidase due to the fact that leucovorin is degraded by glucarpidase.

# Half_Life:
In healthy patients not taking methotrexate, glucarpidase has an elimination half-life of 5.6 hours. In patients with

Used in patients on methotrexate treatment who have kidney dysfunction, and are experiencing an abnormally high plasma concentration of methotrexate (> 1 micromole per liter).

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Glucarpidase inactivates methotrexate, and other antifolates, by hydrolyzing glutamate on the carboxyl terminal of these compounds. For methotrexate specifically, it is hydrolyzed to the inactive metabolites glutamate and 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA).
