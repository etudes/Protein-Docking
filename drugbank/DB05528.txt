# ATC_Codes:
C10AX11

# Absorption:
The maximum mipomersen concentration is reached in about 3-4 hours after subcutaneous injection. Additionally the bioavailability of mipomersn is dose-dependant and ranges from 54%-78%.

# Biotransformation:
Mipomersem is metabolized by endonucleases. Once degraded into shorter oligonucleotides, it is metabolized further by exonucleases.

# Description:
Mipomersen sodium, which was known as the investigational drug, isis-301012, is the salt form of a synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. Mipomersen sodium prevents the formation of apo B-100, resulting in a decrease in the levels of apolipoprotein B (apo B), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol. Mipomersen is indicated in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to diet and other lipid-lowering medications. It is marketed under the brand name Kynamro in the United States, and the FDA label includes a black box warning of hepatoxicity. Specifically, elevations in the liver enzymes, i.e. transaminases, and in liver  fat (hepatic steatosis) have been reported. Due to this serious risk of liver toxicity, mipomersen sodium is only available to patients under the restricted program called Kynamroâ„¢ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program.

# Dosage_Forms:
Solution	Subcutaneous

# Drug_Category:
Antihyperlipidemics

# Drug_Interactions:
Ethanol	The combination of these drugs will likely enhance mipomersen related hepatotoxicity. Therefore patients using both these drugs, should limit their alcohol to a daily maximum of 1 drink (or equivalent).

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D08946

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
5529

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Mipomersen binds to the mRNA that codes for apoB-100. This binding leads to double-stranded RNA, which is degraded by RNase H and prevents translation of the mRNA to form the apo B-100 protein.
