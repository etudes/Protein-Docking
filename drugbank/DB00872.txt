# Pharmacology:
Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP effect is mediated through V<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular <sub>1A</sub> receptors. The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V<sub>2</sub> antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. Conivaptan's antagonist activity on V<sub>1A</sub> receptors may also cause splanchnic vasodilation, resulting in possible hypotension or variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan include increased free water excretion (i.e., effective water clearance [EWC]) generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss, increased urine output, and decreased urine osmolality.

# Toxicity:
Although no data on overdosage in humans are available, conivaptan has been administered as a 20 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by continuous infusion of 80 mg/day for 4 days in hyponatremia patients and up to 120 mg/day for 2 days in CHF patients. No new toxicities were identified at these higher doses, but adverse events related to the pharmacologic activity of conivaptan, e.g. hypotension and thirst, occurred more frequently at these higher doses.
