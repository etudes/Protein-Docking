# AHFS_Codes:

# ATC_Codes:
J01XD02
P01AB02

# Absorption:
Rapidly and completely absorbed under fasting conditions. Administration with food results in a delay in T<sub>max</sub> of approximately 2 hours and a decline in C<sub>max</sub> of approximately 10% and an AUC of 901.6 &plusmn; 126.5 mcg hr/mL.

# Biotransformation:
Hepatic, mainly via CYP3A4. Tinidazole, like metronidazole, is significantly metabolized in humans prior to excretion. Tinidazole is partly metabolized by oxidation, hydroxylation and conjugation. Tinidazole is the major drug-related constituent in plasma after human treatment, along with a small amount of the 2-hydroxymethyl metabolite.

# Indication:
For the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by <i>T. vaginalis</i> in both female and male patients. Also for the treatment of giardiasis caused by <i>G. duodenalis</i> in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age and for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by <i>E. histolytica</i> in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Tinidazole is a prodrug and antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced in <i>Trichomonas</i> by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction is believed to be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. It is suggested that the toxic free radicals covalently bind to DNA, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death. The mechanism by which tinidazole exhibits activity against <i>Giardia</i> and <i>Entamoeba</i> species is not known, though it is probably similar.

# Pharmacology:
Tinidazole is a synthetic antiprotozoal agent. Tinidazole demonstrates activity both in vitro and in clinical infections against the following protozoa: <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> (also termed <i>G. lamblia</i>), and <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>. Tinidazole does not appear to have activity against most strains of vaginal lactobacilli.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
