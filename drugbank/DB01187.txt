# Description:
Iophendylate is a mixture of isomers used as contrast medium, mainly for brain and spinal cord visualization. Iophendylate is a myelographic oil-ester (U.S. Patent 2,348,231). Iophendylate, which was never shown to be safe, was initially introduced for use in small amounts (1-2cc) for locating spinal tumors. It next appeared on the world scene for high volume (12-15cc), routine use, in diagnosing disc herniations. A number of clinicians have published on the dangers of oil myelography. In 1942 Van Wagenen (a neurosurgical colleague of Warrens, at the University of Rochester) identified Iophendylate as causing chemical meningitis in 30 patients where "space-displacing masses within the spinal canal were suspected".

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Iophendylate has been shown to be both a radiographic and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent in patients with suspected cord abnormalities who underwent MR examination following myelography. The iophendylate appears as a linear band of high signal intensity along the dependent portion of the spinal canal on MR images obtained with a repetition time of 500 msec and an echo time of 30 msec.

# Pharmacology:
Iophendylate is a myelographic oil-ester initially introduced for use in small amounts (1-2cc) for locating spinal tumors. Later, it was found to cause adhesive arachnoiditis. Because these substances are hyperbaric once they were placed in the subarachnoid space they would migrate to the distal portion, where they remained, producing progressive scarring.
