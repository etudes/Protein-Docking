# Absorption:
Rapidly absorbed (mean absolute bioavailability of 93% for capsules, and 75% for solution). Food does not effect absorption.

# Biotransformation:
Minimally transformed (13%), most appears unchanged in urine (86%). The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3&prime;-sulfoxide diastereomers (~ 9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2&prime;-O-glucuronide (~ 4% of dose). In vitro studies indicate emtricitabine is not an inhibitor or cytochrome P450 enzymes.

# Description:
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) for the treatment of HIV infection in adults. Emtricitabine is an analogue of cytidine. The drug works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA.

# Dosage_Forms:
Capsule	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Anti-HIV Agents
Antiviral Agents

# Drug_Interactions:
Valganciclovir	The adverse/toxic effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside), such as Emtricitabine, may be enhanced by Valganciclovir. There is a risk of hematologic toxicity. Diligent monitoring during concomitant therapy is recommended.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Emtricitabine works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA. Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, which is responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It competes with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and incorporates into nascent viral DNA, resulting in early chain termination. Therefore emtricitabine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate and by its incorporation into viral DNA. By inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, emtricitabine can help to lower the amount of HIV, or "viral load", in a patient's body and can indirectly increase the number of immune system cells (called T cells or CD4+ T-cells). Both of these changes are associated with healthier immune systems and decreased likelihood of serious illness.

# Pharmacology:
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Emtricitabine helps to block HIV reverse transcriptase, a chemical in your body (enzyme) that is needed for HIV to multiply. Emtricitabine is always used with other anti-HIV medicines to treat people with HIV infection. Emtricitabine may lower the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load). Emtricitabine may also help to increase the number of T cells called CD4 cells. Lowering the amount of HIV in the blood lowers the chance of death or infections that happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections). People taking emtricitabine may still get opportunistic infections or other conditions that happen with HIV infection.
