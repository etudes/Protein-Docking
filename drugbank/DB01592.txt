# Absorption:
The efficiency of absorption depends on the salt form, the amount administered, the dosing regimen and the size of iron stores. Subjects with normal iron stores absorb 10% to 35% of an iron dose. Those who are iron deficient may absorb up to 95% of an iron dose.

# Description:
A metallic element found in certain minerals, in nearly all soils, and in mineral waters. It is an essential constituent of hemoglobin, cytochrome, and other components of respiratory enzyme systems. Its chief functions are in the transport of oxygen to tissue (hemoglobin) and in cellular oxidation mechanisms. Depletion of iron stores may result in iron-deficiency anemia. Iron is used to build up the blood in anemia.

Deferiprone	Deferiprone serum concentrations may be decreased by iron salts except for ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol, iron dextran complex, and iron sucrose.
Demeclocycline	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Doxycycline	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Etidronic acid	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Gatifloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Gemifloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Grepafloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Ibandronate	Formation of non absorbable complexes
Levofloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Levothyroxine	Iron decreases absorption of levothyroxine
Methyldopa	Iron decreases the absorption of dopa derivatives
Minocycline	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Moxifloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Mycophenolate mofetil	Oral iron decreases the absorption of mycophenolate-mofetil
Norfloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Ofloxacin	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Pancrelipase	If pancrelipase and iron salts are used in combination then monitor therapy. Pancrelipase may decrease the absorption of iron salts except for ferumoxytol, iron dextran complex, and iron sucrose.
Penciclovir	The multivalent agent decreases the effect of penicillamine
Tetracycline	Formation of non-absorbable complexes
Trovafloxacin	Iron may decrease the absorption of orally administered Trovafloxacin. Administer Trovafloxacin 2 hours before or 6 hours after a dose of the iron containing agent to minimize the interaction.

# Toxicity:
Acute iron overdosage can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, which occurs up to six hours after ingestion, the principal symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea. Other symptoms include hypotension, tachycardia and CNS depression ranging from lethargy to coma. The second phase may occur at 6-24 hours after ingestion and is characterized by a temporary remission. In the third phase, gastrointestinal symptoms recur accompanied by shock, metabolic acidosis, coma, hepatic necrosis and jaundice, hypoglycemia, renal failure and pulmonary edema. The fourth phase may occur several weeks after ingestion and is characterized by gastrointestinal obstruction and liver damage. In a young child, 75 milligrams per kilogram is considered extremely dangerous. A dose of 30 milligrams per kilogram can lead to symptoms of toxicity. Estimates of a lethal dosage range from 180 milligrams per kilogram and upwards. A peak serum iron concentration of five micrograms or more per ml is associated with moderate to severe poisoning in many.
