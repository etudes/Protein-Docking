# Description:
Valganciclovir hydrochloride (Valcyte, manufactured by Roche) is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus infections. As the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir, it is actually a prodrug for ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. After administration, these diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by hepatic and intestinal esterases. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This triphosphate form is slowly metabolized intracellularly. The phosphorylation is dependent upon the viral kinase and occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. Ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed.

# Pharmacology:
Valganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus infections. As the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir, it is actually a prodrug for ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. After this, it (being an analogue of guanosine) gets incorporated into DNA and thus cannot be properly read by DNA polymerase. This results in the termination of the elongation of viral DNA.

DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
