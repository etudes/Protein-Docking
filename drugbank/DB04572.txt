# Description:
N,N'N'-triethylenethiophosphoramide (ThioTEPA) is a cancer chemotherapeutic member of the alkylating agent group, now in use for over 50 years. It is a stable derivative of N,N',N''- triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA). It is mostly used to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer and bladder cancer. It is also used as conditioning for Bone marrow transplantation. Its main toxicity is myelosuppression.

# Drug_Interactions:
Bendamustine	Increases toxicity through pharmacodynamic synergism. Additive myelosuppression.
Bupropion	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Bupropion, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Bupropion if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Cyclophosphamide	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Cyclophosphamide, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Cyclophosphamide if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Fosphenytoin	Possible increase in thiotepa levels
Irinotecan	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Irinotecan, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Irinotecan if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Ketamine	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Ketamine, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Ketamine if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Natalizumab	The immunosuppressant, Thiotepa, may increase the adverse effects of Natalizumab. Increased risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) and other infections. Concurrent therapy should be avoided.
Phenytoin	Possible increase in thiotepa levels
Promethazine	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Promethazine, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Promethazine if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Selegiline	Thiotepa, a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Selegiline, a CYP2B6 substrate. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of Selegiline if Thiotepa is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Trastuzumab	Trastuzumab may increase the risk of neutropenia and anemia. Monitor closely for signs and symptoms of adverse events.

# Indication:
ThioTEPA is used a as conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or autologous haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in haematological diseases in adult and paediatric patients. Also, when high dose chemotherapy with HPCT support it is appropriate for the treatment of solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C07641

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D00583

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
4572

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The alkyl group is attached to the guanine base of DNA, at the number 7 nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring. They stop tumor growth by crosslinking guanine nucleobases in DNA double-helix strands, directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. These drugs act nonspecifically.

# Pharmacology:
The unstable nitrogen-carbon groups alkylate with DNA causing irrepairable DNA damage. They stop tumor growth by crosslinking guanine nucleobases in DNA double-helix strands, directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. These drugs act nonspecifically.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
