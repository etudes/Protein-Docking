# Description:
Calcium supplements such as calcium gluceptate are taken by individuals who are unable to get enough calcium in their regular diet or who have a need for more calcium. They are used to prevent or treat several conditions that may cause hypocalcemia (not enough calcium in the blood). The body needs calcium to make strong bones. Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly.

# Dosage_Forms:
Solution	Intravenous
Solution	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Antihypermagnesemic Agents
Antihypocalcemic Agents
Electrolyte replenisher
Nutritional supplement, mineral

# Drug_Interactions:
Trovafloxacin	Calcium may decrease the absorption of orally administered Trovafloxacin. Administer Trovafloxacin 2 hours before or 6 hours after a dose of the calcium containing agent to minimize the interaction.

# Pharmacology:
Calcium supplements such as calcium gluceptate are taken by individuals who are unable to get enough calcium in their regular diet or who have a need for more calcium. They are used to prevent or treat several conditions that may cause hypocalcemia (not enough calcium in the blood). The body needs calcium to make strong bones. Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly. The bones serve as a storage site for the body's calcium. They are continuously giving up calcium to the bloodstream and then replacing it as the body's need for calcium changes from day to day. When there is not enough calcium in the blood to be used by the heart and other organs, your body will take the needed calcium from the bones. When you eat foods rich in calcium, the calcium will be restored to the bones and the balance between your blood and bones will be maintained.
