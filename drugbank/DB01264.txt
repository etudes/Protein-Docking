# Drug_Interactions:
Abacavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Darunavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Bromazepam	Darunavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, may increase the serum concentration of bromazepam by decreasing its metabolism. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of bromazepam if darunavir is initiated, discontinued or dose changed. Dosage adjustments may be required.
Clarithromycin	Increased levels of clarithromycin
Dantrolene	Darunavir may increase the serum concentration of dantrolene by decreasing its metabolism. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of dantrolene if darunavir is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Etravirine	Etravirine, when used concomitantly with protease inhibitors, may experience a decrease in serum concentration. 

Protease inhibitors, when used concomitantly with etravirine, may experience an increase in serum concentration. 

Ritonavir boosting of etravirine therapy is a requirement to concurrent therapy. In addition, it is recommended to monitor serum concentrations of the antiretrovirals, as well as to monitor antiretroviral therapy for efficacy.
Lidocaine	Possible increase in lidocaine levels
Lopinavir	Decreased levels of darunavir
Lovastatin	Darunavir may increase the effect and toxicity of lovastatin. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Darunavir is a HIV protease inhibitor which prevents HIV replication by binding to the enzyme's active site, thereby preventing the dimerization and the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease. Darunavir selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus-infected cells, which prevents the formation of mature infectious virus particles. Structual analyses suggests that the close contact that darunavir has with the main chains of the protease active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) is an important contributing factor to its potency and wide spectrum of activity against multi-protease inhibitor resistant HIV-1 variants. Darunavir can also adapt to the changing shape of a protease enzyme because of its molecular flexibility. Darunavir is known to bind to two distinct sites on the enzyme: the active site cavity and the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the protease dimer.

# Pharmacology:
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease.  In studies, the drug, co-administered with ritonavir in combination therapy, significantly reduced viral load and increased CD4 cell counts in this treatment-experienced patient population (Tibotec, 2006, Product Monograph, Prezista 2006). Darunavir is used as an adjunct therapy with low dose ritonavir, which inhibits cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) which increases the bioavailability and half life of darunavir.
