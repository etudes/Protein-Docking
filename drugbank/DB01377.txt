# Description:
Magnesium oxide is an inorganic compound that occurs in nature as the mineral periclase. In aqueous media combines quickly with water to form magnesium hydroxide. It is used as an antacid and mild laxative and has many nonmedicinal uses. [PubChem]

# Indication:
Magnesium hydroxide is used as a laxative to relieve occasional constipation (irregularity) and as an antacid to relieve indigestion, sour stomach, and heartburn.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C12567

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D01167

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
1377

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The term "Milk of Magnesia" was first used to describe a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken internally by mouth as a laxative, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension acts to draw fluids from the body and to retain those already within the lumen of the intestine, serving to distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and resulting in evacuation of colonic contents. Magnesium supplements have also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting in the influx of calcium, a crucial component of platelet aggregation.
