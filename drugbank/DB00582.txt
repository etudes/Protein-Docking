# Indication:
For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and serious fungal infections caused by <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i> and <i>Fusarium</i> spp.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:
C07622

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D00578

# LIMS_Drug_ID:

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Voriconazole binds and inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450-dependent 14-alpha sterol demethylase. The inhibition of 14-alpha sterol demethylase results in a depletion of ergosterol in fungal cell membrane.

# Pharmacology:
Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent indicated for use in the treatment of fungal infections including invasive aspergillosis, esophageal candidiasis, and serious fungal infections caused by <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i> (asexual form of <i>Pseudallescheria boydii</i>) and <i>Fusarium</i> spp. including <i>Fusarium solani</i>. Fungal plasma membranes are similar to mammalian plasma membranes, differing in having the nonpolar sterol ergosterol, rather than cholesterol, as the principal sterol. Membrane sterols such as ergosterol provide structure, modulation of membrane fluidity, and possibly control of some physiologic events. Voriconazole effects the formation of the fungal plasma membrane by indirectly inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol. This results in plasma membrane permeability changes and inhibition of growth.

# Toxicity:
The minimum lethal oral dose in mice and rats was 300 mg/kg (equivalent to 4 and 7 times the recommended maintenance dose (RMD), based on body surface area). At this dose, clinical signs observed in both mice and rats included salivation, mydriasis, titubation (loss of balance while moving), depressed behavior, prostration, partially closed eyes, and dyspnea. Other signs in mice were convulsions, corneal opacification and swollen abdomen.

# Drug_Target_1_Reaction:
obtusifoliol + 3 O2 + 3 NADPH + 3 H+ = 4alpha-methyl-5alpha-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien-3beta-ol + formate + 3 NADP+ + 4 H2O

# Drug_Target_1_Signals:
None

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
Catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis. It transforms lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol
