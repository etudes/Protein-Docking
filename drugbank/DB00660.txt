# Description:
Metaxalone (marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Skelaxin®) is a muscle relaxant used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it may be due to general central nervous system depression. It is considered to be a moderately strong muscle relaxant, with relatively low incidence of side effects. Skelaxin comes in an 800 mg scored tablet. It previously came in both 400 mg and 800 mg tablets. The 400 mg tablet has been discontinued. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and CNS side effects such as dizziness, headache, and irritability.

# Pharmacology:
Metaxalone is a skeletal muscle relaxant indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man.

# Toxicity:
LD<sub>50</sub>=775mg/kg (Rat, oral); LD<sub>50</sub>=1690 mg/kg (Mouse, oral). When determining the LD<sub>50</sub> in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis and finally respiratoryfailure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD<sub>50</sub> could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes.
