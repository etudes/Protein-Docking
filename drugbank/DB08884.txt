# Description:
Gadoxetate is a paramagnetic gadolinium-containing contrast agent in which its salt form, gadoxetate disodium, is used for intravenous injection. Ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid is the moiety that chelates with a gadolinium ion and forms a stable complex with it to make up the drug. It is marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and FDA approved on July 3, 2008.

# Dosage_Forms:
Injection, solution	Intravenous

# Drug_Category:
Diagnostic Agents

# Drug_Interactions:
Rifampin	Substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may limit uptake of gadoxetate disodium into heptatocytes. This may alter the intensity of the signal.

# Indication:
Gadoxetate is used as a contrast medium for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and characterize lesions in the liver.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
When gadoxetate disodium is placed in an external magnetic field, a large magnetic moment is produced. As a result, a magnetic field is induced around the tissue. The water protons in the vicinity are disrupted such that the change the proton density and spin characteristics are detected and visualized by a device.

# Pharmacology:
Gadoxetate disodium is an amphipathic compound in which gadoxetate is hydrophillic and its moiety, the ethoxybenyzl group, is lipophillic. Consequently, gadoxetate disodium has a biphasic mode of action in which it first distributes into the extracellular space after bolus injection and then hepatocytes selectively takes up the drug.

# Predicted_Water_Solubility:

# Primary_Accession_No:
DB08884

# Protein_Binding:
<10% protein bound. Because it is more protein bound than other gadolinium-based contrast agents, gadoxetate disodium has increased T1 relaxivity. This results in an enhancement of the signal.
