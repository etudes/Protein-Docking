# Description:
An antibiotic derived from penicillin similar to carbenicillin in action.

# Dosage_Forms:
Not Available

# Drug_Category:
Anti-Bacterial Agents
Penicillins

# Drug_Interactions:
Amikacin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Amikacin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Amikacin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.
Demeclocycline	Demeclocycline may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Demeclocycline.
Doxycycline	Doxycycline may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Doxycycline.
Ethinyl Estradiol	This anti-infectious agent could decrease the effect of the oral contraceptive
Fusidic Acid	Fusidic acid may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Fusidic acid.
Gentamicin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Gentamicin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Gentamicin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.
Kanamycin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Kanamycin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Kanamycin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.
Methotrexate	The penicillin increases the effect and toxicity of methotrexate
Minocycline	Minocycline may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Minocycline.
Neomycin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Neomycin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Neomycin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.
Oxytetracycline	Oxytetracycline may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Oxytetracycline.
Streptomycin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Streptomycin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Streptomycin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.
Tetracycline	Tetracycline may reduce the effect of Ticarcillin by inhibiting bacterial growth. Ticarcillin exerts its effects on actively growing bacteria. To achieve synergism, Ticarcillin should be administered at least 2 hours prior to using Tetracycline.
Tobramycin	Ticarcillin may reduce the serum concentration of Tobramycin. Ticarcillin may inactivate Tobramycin in vitro and the two agents should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line.

C07139

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
Not Available

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
1607

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Ticarcillin's antibiotic properties arise from its ability to prevent cross-linking of peptidoglycan during cell wall synthesis when the bacteria tries to divide, causing death.

# Pharmacology:
Ticarcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ticarcillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by ÃŸ-lactamases, and therefore, the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes.
