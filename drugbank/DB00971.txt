# Description:
Selenium Sulfide is an antifungal agent as well as a cytostatic agent, slowing the growth of hyperproliferative cells in seborrhea. Selenium Sulfide is the active ingredient often used in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis and tinea capitis, a fungal infection that is primarily a disease of preadolescent children.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Topical selenium sulfide may act by an antimitotic action, resulting in a reduction in the turnover of epidermal cells. It also has local irritant, antibacterial, and mild antifungal activity, which may contribute to its effectiveness. An antimitotic mechanism of action is suggested by data showing that selenium sulfide decreases the rate of incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine into the DNA of dermal epithelial cells. The following organisms are generally considered susceptible to selenium sulfide in vitro: <i>Malassezia furfur</i>, <i>Microsporum sp.</i> including <i>Microsporum audouinii</i> and <i>Microsporum canis</i>, <i>Pityrosporon sp.</i>, <i>Trichophyton sp.</i> including <i>Trichophyton schoenleinii</i> and <i>Trichophyton tonsurans</i>. Selenium sulfide has been shown to be sporicidal to <i>T. tonsurans</i>, the most common etiologic agent of tinea capitis. One in-vitro study demonstrated that 2.5% selenium sulfide was equivalent in sporicidal activity to both 1% and 2% zinc pyrithione.

# Pharmacology:
Selenium sulfide is an antifungal agent often used in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Selenium sulfide is highly active in inhibiting the growth of <i>P. ovale</i>. It is also a proven cytostatic agent, slowing the growth of both hyperproliferative and normal cells in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. A 0.6% micronized form of selenium sulfide is also safe and effective for dandruff.
