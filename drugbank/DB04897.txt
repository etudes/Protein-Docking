# Description:
Lucinactant is a new synthetic peptide-containing surfactant for intratracheal use. It contains sinapultide, a novel, hydrophobic, 21-amino acid peptide (leucine and lysine repeating units, KL4 peptide) designed to mimic human surfactant protein-B (SB-P). More specifically, it mimics the C-terminal amphipathic helical domain of this protein. It also consists of phospholipids (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol, POPG) and a fatty acid (palmitic acid). It is completely devoid of animal-derived components. FDA approved on March 6, 2012.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex that is produced naturally in the lungs, where it lines the alveolar epithelium and serves to reduce surface tension, which facilitates alveoli expansion and allows gas exchange. Human surfactants contain phospholipids, predominantly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), in addition to surfactant proteins A, B, C and D. Surfactant is also a physical barrier to inhaled particle and noxious agents, enhances particle clearance, is involved in host defense against infection and possesses antiinflammatory properties. Several serious respiratory disorders have been associated with a loss or lack of endogenous surfactant. Lucinactant was designed to mimic the essential endogenous human surfactant protein B (SP-B).

# Pharmacology:
Lucinactant is a new synthetic surfactant containing a protein that mimics human surfactant protein-B, is effective at preventing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and related complications in preterm infants. Lucinactant has been shown to have antiinflammatory properties, is resistant to proteolytic degradation and oxidation, and has no potential for transmitting animal-derived diseases. Lucinactant has proven safe and effective in the prevention of RDS in preterm infants and as a treatment for MAS in full-term infants and for adult ARDS.
