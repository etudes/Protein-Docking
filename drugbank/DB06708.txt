# Description:
Lumefantrine is an antimalarial agent used to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. It is administered in combination with artemether for improved efficacy. This combination therapy exerts its effects against the erythrocytic stages of <i>Plasmodium spp.</i> and may be used to treat infections caused by <i>P. falciparum</i> and unidentified <i>Plasmodium</i> species, including infections acquired in chloroquine-resistant areas.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The exact mechanism by which lumefantrine exerts its antimalarial effect is unknown. However, available data suggest that lumefantrine inhibits the formation of &beta;-hematin by forming a complex with hemin and inhibits nucleic acid and protein synthesis.

# Pharmacology:
Lumefantrine is a blood schizonticide active against erythrocytic stages of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. It is thought that administration of lumefantrine with artemether results in cooperate antimalarial clearing effects. Artemether has a rapid onset of action and is rapidly cleared from the body. It is thus thought to provide rapid symptomatic relief by reducing the number of malarial parasites. Lumefantrine has a much longer half life and is believed to clear residual parasites.
