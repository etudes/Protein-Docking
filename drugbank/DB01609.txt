# AHFS_Codes:

# ATC_Codes:
V03AC03

# Absorption:
The absolute bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension is 70% compared to an intravenous dose.

# Biotransformation:
Hepatic. CYP450-catalyzed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion.

# Description:
Deferasirox is an oral iron chelator. Its main use is to reduce chronic iron overload in patients who are receiving long term blood transfusions for conditions such as beta-thalassemia and other chronic anemias. It is the first oral medication approved in the USA for this purpose.

# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet, for suspension	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Iron Chelating Agents

# Drug_Interactions:
Aluminium	Possible physicochemical interaction
Bivalirudin	Anticoagulants increase the risk for gastrointestinal ulceration/irritation and/or GI bleeding. If these two agents must be used, patients need to be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of GI toxicity.
Etravirine	Etravirine, when administered concomitantly with deferasirox, may experience a decrease in serum concentration. It is recommended to monitor therapy.
Tofacitinib	Tofacitinib (and other CYP3A4 substrates), when used in combination with deferasirox, may experience a decrease in concentration. It is recommended to monitor therapy.

# Food_Interactions:
Dispersion in carbonated drinks or milk is not recommended due to foaming and slow dispersion, respectively.
Food causes inconsistent increases in the bioavailability of this product.
Tablets should be completely dispersed in water, orange juice or apple juice and the resulting suspension should be ingested immediately (after swallowing the suspension, any residue should be resuspended in a small volume of liquid and swallowed).
Tablets should be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before a meal, preferably at the same time everyday.

For the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and older.

# KEGG_Drug_ID:
D03669

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
1609

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron. Deferasirox works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys.

# Pharmacology:
Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe3+). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.
