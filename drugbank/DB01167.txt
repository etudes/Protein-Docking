# Absorption:
The absolute oral bioavailability of itraconazole is 55%, and is maximal when taken with a full meal.

# Biotransformation:
Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver into a large number of metabolites, including hydroxyitraconazole, the major metabolite. The main metabolic pathways are oxidative scission of the dioxolane ring, aliphatic oxidation at the 1-methylpropyl substituent, N-dealkylation of this 1-methylpropyl substituent, oxidative degradation of the piperazine ring and triazolone scission.

# KEGG_Compound_ID:

# KEGG_Drug_ID:

# LIMS_Drug_ID:
1167

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Itraconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Itraconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis.

# Pharmacology:
Itraconazole is an imidazole/triazole type antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 &alpha;-demethylation via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14&alpha;-demethylase. This enzyme converts lanosterol to ergosterol, and is required in fungal cell wall synthesis. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14 &alpha;-methyl sterols in fungi and may be partly responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition. Itraconazole exhibits <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Candida spp.</i> Fungistatic activity has also been demonstrated in normal and immunocompromised animal models for systemic and intracranial fungal infections due to <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and for systemic infections due to <i>Candida albicans</i>.
