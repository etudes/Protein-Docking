# Drug_Interactions:
Alendronate	Calcium Salts may decrease the serum concentration of Bisphosphonate Derivatives such as alendronate. Avoid administration of oral calcium supplements within 30 minutes after alendronate.
Calcium Chloride	Calcium salts may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of calcium acetate. Concurrent use of other calcium salts with calcium acetate should be avoided when possible. This combination is particularly dangerous in patients with other risk factors for hypercalcemia, such as those with end-stage renal disease.
Calcium carbonate	Calcium salts may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of calcium acetate. Concurrent use of other calcium salts with calcium acetate should be avoided when possible. This combination is particularly dangerous in patients with other risk factors for hypercalcemia, such as those with end-stage renal disease.
Ceftriaxone	Calcium Salts (Intravenous) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone binds to calcium forming an insoluble precipitate. Concurrent or sequential use (within 48 hours) of ceftriaxone with calcium-containing solutions is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger). In other patients, these solutions can be used sequentially if the infusion lines are flushed with a compatible fluid between ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solution infusion.
Ciprofloxacin	Calcium salts such as calcium acetate may decrease the absorption of quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin. Of concern only with oral administration of both agents. Interactions can be minimized by administering oral quinolone at least 2 hours before, or 6 hours after, the dose of an oral calcium supplement. Monitor for decreased therapeutic effects of oral quinolones if administered with oral calcium supplements.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Calcium acetate and other calcium salts are phosphate binders. They work by binding with the phosphate in the food you eat, so that it is eliminated from the body without being absorbed.

# Pharmacology:
Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders. Calcium acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH, making the calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine.
