# Description:
Bentoquatam is a topical medication intended to act as a shield against exposure to the irritating substance urushiol, found in plants such as poison ivy or poison oak. Bentoquatam contains bentonite, a clay, and is only effective as long as the film is visible on the skin.

# Indication:
Used to prevent or reduce the severity of allergic contact dermatitis due to urushiol, the allergenic resin of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought topically applied bentoquatam acts as a physical barrier that interferes with the adsorption of antigens onto the skin and reduces absorption of antigens into the skin. It probably does not work by modifying the systemic allergic response.

# Pharmacology:
Bentoquatam protects the skin like a shield against poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac by physically blocking skin contact with their resin. The best protection against getting these conditions is to avoid contact with these plants. This medicine does not dry oozing and weeping caused by the rash of poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.
