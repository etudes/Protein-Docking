# Description:
Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwiniachryanthemi) contains an asparaginase specific enzyme derived from Erwiniachrysanthemi. L-asparaginase is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of four identical subunits, each having a molecular weight of about 35 kDa. The activity of Erwinaze is expressed in terms of International Units. It is an antineoplastic agent and was FDA approved in November 19, 2011.

# Generic_Name:
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi

# HET_ID:
Not Available

# Half_Life:
Elimination half-life, IM injection = 16 hours. Compared to E. coli-asparaginase, it has a lower half-life so higher and more frequent doses are necessary.

# InChI_Identifier:

# InChI_Key:

# Indication:
Asparaginase Erwinia chryanthemi is for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that have developed a hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli-derivied asparaginase. It is a component of a multi-agent chemotherpeutic regimen for the treatment of the aforementioned disease and is considered second- or third- line treatment in European and American protocols.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi catalyzes the deamidation of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, resulting in a reduction in circulating levels of asparagine in the plasma. The mechanism of action of Erwinaze is thought to be based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesize asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukemic cells that depend on an exogenous source of the amino acid asparagine for their protein metabolism and survival.

# Toxicity:
Because Erwinaze is injected intramuscularly, there is a higher chance of experiencing major skin reactions. Although the perceived benefit of Erwinia chryanthemi-derivied asparaginase is a lower incidence of hypersensitivity, there is still a chance that one may experience symptoms such as, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, pain, edema. Pancreatitis may also occur during the first few weeks of treatment with asparaginase.
