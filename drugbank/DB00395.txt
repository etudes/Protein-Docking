# Description:
A centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant whose mechanism of action is not completely understood but may be related to its sedative actions. It is used as an adjunct in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions associated with painful muscle spasm. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1202)

# Drug_Interactions:
Delavirdine	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as delavirdine may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Droperidol	Droperidol may enhance the CNS depressant effect of carisoprodol. Consider dose reductions of droperidol or of other CNS agents with concomitant use.
Fluconazole	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as fluconazole may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Fluvoxamine	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Gemfibrozil	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Isoniazid	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as isoniazid may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Methotrimeprazine	Carisoprodol, a CNS depressant, may enhance the CNS depressant effect of methotrimeprazine. Methotrimeprazine may enhance the CNS depressant effect of CNS Depressants like carisoprodol. Reduce the dosage of CNS depressants by 50% with initiation of concomitant methotrimeprazine therapy. Further CNS depressant dosage adjustments should be initiated only after clinically effective methotrimeprazine dose has been established. Monitor for increased CNS depression with concomitant therapy.
Modafinil	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as modafinil may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Sitaxentan	Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors such as sitaxentan may decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates such as carisoprodol. Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs in order to avoid toxicity of the substrate. Some combinations are specifically contraindicated by manufacturers. Suggested dosage adjustments are also offered by some manufacturers. Please review applicable package inserts. Monitor for increased effects of the CYP substrate if a CYP inhibitor is initiated/dose increased, and decreased effects if a CYP inhibitor is discontinued/dose decreased.
Ticlopidine	Ticlopidine may decrease the metabolism and clearance of Carisoprodol. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for adverse/toxic effects of Carisoprodol if Ticlopidine is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Triprolidine	The CNS depressants, Triprolidine and Carisoprodol, may increase adverse/toxic effects due to additivity. Monitor for increased CNS depressant effects during concomitant therapy.

# LIMS_Drug_ID:

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Carisoprodol is a central nervous system depressant that acts as a sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant. Rather than acting directly on skeletal muscle, carisoprodol interrupts neuronal communication within the reticular formation and spinal cord, resulting in sedation and alteration in pain perception. Its exact mechanism of action is not yet known.
