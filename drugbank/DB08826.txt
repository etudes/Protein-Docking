# AHFS_Codes:
64:00

# ATC_Codes:
V03AC02

# Absorption:
Deferiprone is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Absorption is rapid with maximum plasma concentrations occurring after 1 hour in the fasted state and after 2 hours in the fed state.

# Biotransformation:
Deferiprone is mainly metabolized by UGT1A6 to the 3-O-glucuronide metabolite. This metabolite cannot chelate iron.

# Description:
Deferiprone is an oral iron chelator used as a second line agent in thalassemia syndromes when iron overload from blood transfusions occurs. Thalassemias are a type of hereditary anaemia due a defect in the production of hemoglobin. As a result, erythropoiesis, the production of new red blood cells, is impaired. FDA approved on October 14, 2011.

# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Chelating agent

# Drug_Interactions:
Aluminum hydroxide	Deferiprone may decrease gastrointestinal absorption by chelating to other ions. Interaction is significant so monitor closely.
Calcium	Deferiprone serum concentrations may be decreased by calcium salts.
Iron	Deferiprone serum concentrations may be decreased by iron salts except for ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol, iron dextran complex, and iron sucrose.
Iron Dextran	Deferiprone may decrease gastrointestinal absorption by chelating to other ions. Interaction is significant so monitor closely.
Iron sucrose	Deferiprone may decrease gastrointestinal absorption by chelating to other ions. Interaction is significant so monitor closely.
Magnesium	Deferiprone serum concentrations may be decreased by magnesium salts.
Sodium bicarbonate	Deferiprone may decrease gastrointestinal absorption by chelating to other ions. Interaction is significant so monitor closely.
Zinc	Deferiprone serum concentrations may be decreased by zinc salts except for zinc chloride.

# LIMS_Drug_ID:

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Deferiprone is an iron chelator that binds to ferric ions (iron III) and forms a 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) stable complex and is then eliminated in the urine. Deferiprone is more selective for iron in which other metals such as zinc, copper, and aluminum have a lower affinity for deferiprone.
