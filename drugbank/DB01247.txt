# Dosage_Forms:
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Antidepressants
Antidepressive Agents
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

# Drug_Interactions:
Almotriptan	The MAO inhibitor, isocarboxazid, may decrease the metabolism and clearance of the serotonin 5-HT receptor agonist, almotriptan. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Altretamine	Risk of severe hypotension
Amitriptyline	Possibility of severe adverse effects
Amoxapine	Possibility of severe adverse effects
Amphetamine	Possible hypertensive crisis
Atomoxetine	Possible severe adverse reaction with this combination
Benzphetamine	MAO Inhibitors may enhance the hypertensive effect of Amphetamines. Concomitant use of amphetamines and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) should be avoided. If used concomitantly, careful monitoring of blood pressure must occur. It may take up to 2 weeks after the discontinuation of an MAOI for the effects to dissipate enough to afford safety to the administration of interacting agents.
Bezafibrate	MAO Inhibitors may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bezafibrate. Avoid concomitant use of bezafibrate with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like isocarboxazid.
Brimonidine	MAO Inhibitors like isocarboxazid may enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha2-Agonists (Ophthalmic). The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and ophthalmic alpha2 agonists is contraindicated.
Buprenorphine	Buprenorphine may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of MAO Inhibitors like isocarboxazid. When possible, avoid use of buprenorphine in patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within the past 14 days due to possible severe adverse effects.

Venlafaxine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Ensure adequate washout period between therapies to avoid toxicity. Concurrent therapy should be avoided.
Vilazodone	MAO Inhibitors may enhance the serotonergic effect of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. This may cause serotonin syndrome. Avoid combination.
Zolmitriptan	The MAO inhibitor, isocarboxazid, may increase the serum concentration of zolmitriptan by decreasing its metabolism. Concomitant therapy and use of zolmitriptan within two weeks of discontinuing isocarboxazid are contraindicated.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Isocarboxazid works by irreversibly blocking the action of a chemical substance known as monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the nervous system. MAO subtypes A and B are involved in the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Isocarboxazid, as a nonselective MAO inhibitor, binds irreversibly to monoamine oxidase&ndash;A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase&ndash;B (MAO-B). The reduced MAO activity results in an increased concentration of these neurotransmitters in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. This increased availability of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors.

# Pharmacology:
Isocarboxazid is a non-selective hydrazine monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor used to treat depression. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated inhibition of MAO in the brain, heart, and liver. Depression is a complicated disease that is not fully understood. It is thought that depression may be linked to an imbalance of chemicals within the brain. When depression occurs, there may be a decrease in the amount of chemicals released from nerve cells in the brain. These chemicals are called monoamines. Monoamines are broken down by a chemical called monoamine oxidase. Isocarboxazid prevents monoamine oxidase from breaking down the monoamines. This results in an increased amount of active monoamines in the brain. By increasing the amount of monoamines in the brain, the imbalance of chemicals thought to be caused by depression is altered. This helps relieve the symptoms of depression.
