# Absorption:
Once ingested, dimethyl fumarate is rapidly hydroylyzed by esterases to MMF. Thus there is negligible amount of dimethyl fumarate in the body, and all pharmacokinetic information is quantified with MMF. In multiple sclerosis patients, the time to maximum concentration of MMF is 2 to 2.5 hours and the maximum concentration is 1.87 mg/L.

# Biotransformation:
Dimethly fumarate is hydrozlied to its metabolite MMF in the GIT, tissues, and blood by esterases. MMF then undergoes subsequent metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Altogether the main metabolites formed are MMF, glucose, citric acid, and fumaric.

# Description:
Dimethyl fumarate is an anti-inflammatory. It is indicated for multiple sclerosis patients with relapsing forms and is also being investigated for the treatment of psoriasis. The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis is not well understood. It is thought to involve dimethyl fumarate degradation to its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) then MMF up-regulates the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway that is activated in response to oxidative stress. Dimethyl fumarate is marketed under the brand name Tecfidera.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis is not well understood. It is thought to involve dimethyl fumarate degradation to its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF). MMF up-regulates the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway that is activated in response to oxidative stress. As well MMF is an agonist at the nicotinic acid receptor, but the relevance of this is not known.
