# Absorption:
Raxibacumab does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. When a single IV dose of 40 mg/kg was administered to healthy, male and female human subjects, the pharmacokinetic parameters are as follows:
Cmax = 1020.3 ± 140.6 mcg/mL;
AUCinf = 15845.8 ± 4333.5 mcg·day/mL.
Bioavailability is also dependent on site of injection. When administered to the vastus lateralis, the bioavailability is 71-85%. When administered to the gluteus maximus, the bioavailability is 50-54%.

# Description:
Raxibacumab is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that binds the protective antigen (PA) component of B. anthracis toxin. Raxibacumab has a molecular weight of approximately 146 kilodaltons. Raxibacumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a murine cell expression system. FDA approved on December 14, 2012.

# Indication:
Raxibacumab is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds free PA with an affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.78 ± 0.9 nM. Raxibacumab inhibits the binding of PA to its cellular receptors, preventing the intracellular entry of the anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin. It does not have direct antibacterial activity.
