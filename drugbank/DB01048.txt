# Description:
Abacavir (ABC) is a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used to treat HIV and AIDS. [Wikipedia]

# Dosage_Forms:
Solution	Oral
Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Anti-HIV Agents
Nucleoside and Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors

# Drug_Interactions:
Amprenavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Amprenavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Atazanavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Atazanavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Darunavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Darunavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Ethanol	Abacavir is partly metabolized through the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme system. Alcohol increases the area under the curve (about 41%) of Abacavir. Interaction does not appear to be clinically significant.
Fosamprenavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Fosamprenavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Ganciclovir	The adverse/toxic effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside), such as Abacavir, may be enhanced by Ganciclovir. There is a risk of hematologic toxicity. Diligent monitoring during concomitant therapy is required.
Indinavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Indinavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Lopinavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Lopinavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Nelfinavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Nelfinavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Ribavirin	Ribavirin may increase the hepatotoxicity of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside) such as Abacavir. Lactic acidosis may occur. Consider modifying therapy.
Ribavirin Monophosphate	Ribavirin Monophosphate may increase the hepatotoxicity of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside) such as Abacavir. Lactic acidosis may occur. Consider modifying therapy.
Ritonavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Ritonavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Saquinavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Saquinavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Tipranavir	The serum concentration of Abacavir may be decreased by protease inhibitors such as Tipranavir. The antiviral response should be closely monitored.
Valganciclovir	The adverse/toxic effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside), such as Abacavir, may be enhanced by Valganciclovir. There is a risk of hematologic toxicity. Diligent monitoring during concomitant therapy is recommended.

# LIMS_Drug_ID:

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.

# Pharmacology:
Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Abacavir is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.
