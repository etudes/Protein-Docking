# Absorption:
There is a linear relationship between dose administered and Cmax and AUC. A mean Cmax of approximately 43 to 49 mcg/mL occurred at Week 5 during the initial loading dose period using the recommended dose regimen for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (400 mg sc at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg every other week).
Tmax, SubQ dose = 54 - 171 hours;
Bioavailability, SubQ dose = 80% (range of 76% - 88%)

# Description:
Certolizumab pegol is a recombinant Fab' antibody fragment against tumor necrosis factor alpha which is conjugated to an approximately 40kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG2MAL40K). Polyethylene glycol helps to delay the metabolism and elimination of the drugs. Chemically, the light chain is made up of 214 amino acid residues while the heavy chain is composed of 229 amino acid residues. The molecular mass of the Fab' antibody fragment itself is 47.8 kDa. It is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. FDA approved on April 22, 2008

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Certolizumab pegol binds to free and membrane-bound human TNFα with a KD of 90pM and neutralizes its activity. Extent of neutralization is also dose-dependent. It also inhibited the release of lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-1β from monocytes. TNFα is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes in which elevated levels have been observed in patients with RA and Crohn's. Certolizumab pegol selectively neutralizes TNFα (IC90 of 4 ng/mL for inhibition of human TNFα in the in vitro L929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay). It does not bind to TNF-β. As certolizumab is only a Fab' fragment and thus missing the Fc region, it does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, apoptosis of monocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation have not been observed in vitro.

# Pharmacology:
TNFα is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Biological activity associated to TNFα include the upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and direct leukocyte activation. TNFα stimulates the production of downstream inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide. After treatment with certolizumab pegol, patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated a decrease in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).
