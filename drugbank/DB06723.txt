# Description:
Aluminum hydroxide is an inorganic salt used as an antacid. It is a basic compound that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Subsequent increases in pH may inhibit the action of pepsin. An increase in bicarbonate ions and prostaglandins may also confer cytoprotective effects.

# Drug_Category:
Antacids

# Drug_Interactions:
Calcipotriol	Vitamin D Analogs may increase the serum concentration of Aluminum Hydroxide. Specifically, the absorption of aluminum may be increased, leading to increased serum aluminum concentrations. Avoid chronic and/or excessive use of aluminum and aluminum-containing products in patients who are also taking vitamin D analogs. Any patients consuming such a combination should be monitored closely for aluminum status and signs/symptoms of aluminum-related toxicities.
Cholecalciferol	Vitamin D analogs such as cholecalciferol may increase the serum concentration of aluminum hydroxide. Specifically, the absorption of aluminum may be increased, leading to increased serum aluminum concentrations. Avoid chronic and/or excessive use of aluminum and aluminum-containing products in patients who are also taking vitamin D analogs. Any patients consuming such a combination should be monitored closely for aluminum status and signs/symptoms of aluminum-related toxicities.
Deferiprone	Deferiprone may decrease gastrointestinal absorption by chelating to other ions. Interaction is significant so monitor closely.
Eltrombopag	Decreases levels of eltrombopag by GI absorption inhibition.

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Aluminum hydroxide is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Aluminum hydroxide is slowly solubilized in the stomach and reacts with hydrochloric acid to form aluminum chloride and water. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption. Cytoprotective effects may occur through increases in bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and prostaglandins.

# Pharmacology:
Gastric-peptic disease occurs as a result of an imbalance between protective factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and prostaglandin secretion, and aggressive factors, such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Antacids work by restoring acid-base balance, attenuating the pepsin activity and increasing bicarbonate and prostaglandin secretion.
