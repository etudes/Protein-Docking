# ATC_Codes:
G01AX06

# Absorption:
Radiolabeled drug studies indicate that furazolidone is well absorbed following oral administration

# Biotransformation:
Furazolidone is rapidly and extensively metabolized; the primary metabolic pathway identified begins with nitro-reduction to the aminofuran derivative. Two major metabolites are produced: 3-amino-2-oxazolidone (AOZ) or beta-hydroxyethylhydrazine (HEH). AOZ is responsible for monoamine oxidase inhibition. Detoxification and elimination of the drug is done primarily by conjugation with glutathione.

# Description:
A nitrofuran derivative with antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity. Furazolidone binds bacterial DNA which leads to the gradual inhibition of monoamine oxidase. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p514)

Tablet	Oral

# Drug_Category:
Anti-Infective Agents, Local
Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary
Antitrichomonal Agents
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

# Drug_Interactions:
Milnacipran	Increase serotonin levels. Combination therapy is contraindicated.
Tetrabenazine	Tetrabenazine may increase the adverse/toxic effects of Furazolidine. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Tolcapone	Tolcapone and Furazolidone decrease the metabolism of endogenous catecholamines. Concomitant therapy may result in increased catecholamine effects. Consider alternate therapy or use cautiously and monitor for increased catecholamine effects.
Tramadol	Tramadol increases the risk of serotonin syndrome and seizure induction by the MAO inhibitor, Furazolidone.
Tranylcypromine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Use caution during concomitant therapy and monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Trazodone	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Trimipramine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Ensure adequate washout period between therapies to avoid toxicity. Avoid combination or monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome and/or hypertensive crisis.
Venlafaxine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Ensure adequate washout period between therapies to avoid toxicity. Concurrent therapy should be avoided.
Zolmitriptan	The MAO inhibitor, furazolidine, may increase the serum concentration of zolmitriptan by decreasing its metabolism. Concomitant therapy and use of zolmitriptan within two weeks of discontinuing furazolidine are contraindicated.

# Pharmacology:
Furoxone has a broad antibacterial spectrum covering the majority of gastrointestinal tract pathogens including E. coli, staphylococci, Salmonella, Shigella, Proteus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Vibrio cholerae and Giardia lamblia. Its bactericidal activity is based upon its interference with DNA replication and protein production; this antimicrobial action minimizes the development of resistant organisms.

# Toxicity:
Reactions to Furoxone have been reported including a fall in blood pressure, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, and a vesicular morbilliform rash. Other adverse effects can include a brown discoloration of the urine; hemolysis can occur in G6PDH-deficient patients. The drug has a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory effect and should never be given concurrently to individuals already taking MAO inhibitors.

# Drug_Target_1_Specific_Function:
DNA is the molecule of heredity, as it is responsible for the genetic propagation of most inherited traits. It is a polynucleic acid that carries genetic information on cell growth, division, and function. DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix and held together by hydrogen bonds. The sequence of nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics. Each strand serves as the template for subsequent DNA replication and as a template for mRNA production, leading to protein synthesis via ribosomes.
