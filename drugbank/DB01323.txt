Amprenavir	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of indinavir
Atazanavir	St. John's Wort decreases the levels/effects of atazanavir
Axitinib	Avoid combination due to the likely decreased levels of axitinib.
Boceprevir 	Strong CYP3A4 inducers will decrease levels of boceprevir. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Cabazitaxel	Concomitant therapy with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease concentrations of cabazitaxel. Avoid concomitant therapy.
Cabozantinib	Avoid combination. May decrease concentration of cabozantinib. Also avoid all other strong CYP3A4 inducers.
Citalopram	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, citalopram.
Clonazepam	St. John's Wort may decrease the effect of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam.
Cyclosporine	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of cyclosporine

Digoxin	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of digoxin
Efavirenz	St. John's Wort decreases the antiretroviral effect
Erlotinib	Decreased levels/effect of erlotinib
Escitalopram	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, escitalopram.
Estradiol valerate/Dienogest 	Affects CYP3A4 metabolism, decreases or effects levels of Estradiol valerate/Dienogest.
Ethinyl Estradiol	St. John's Wort could reduce the contraceptive effect
Etravirine	Etravirine may experience a decrease in serum concentration. It is recommended to avoid concurrent therapy.
Fluoxetine	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, fluoxetine.
Fluvoxamine	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, fluvoxamine.
Fosamprenavir	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of indinavir
Gefitinib	The CYP3A4 inducer, St. John's Wort, may decrease the serum concentration and therapeutic effects of gefitinib.
Imatinib	St. John's Wort decreases levels of imatinib
Indinavir	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of indinavir
Ivacaftor	Strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease levels of ivacaftor. Monitor concomitant therapy closely.
Methadone	St. John's Wort decreases levels/effect of methadone
Midazolam	St. John's Wort may decrease the effect of the benzodiazepine, midazolam.
Nefazodone	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, nefazodone.

Omeprazole	St. John's Wort decreases the levels/effects of omeprazole
Oxtriphylline	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of theophylline
Paclitaxel	Avoid combination due to potential decrease in serum concentration of paclitaxel.
Paroxetine	St. John's Wort increases the effect and toxicity of the SSRI, paroxetine.
Perampanel	Avoid combination due to the potential decrease in perampanel concentration.
Rasagiline	Increased risk of toxicity with this association
Regorafenib	Strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease levels of regorafenib.
Roflumilast	Affects CYP3A4 metabolism, decreases level or effect of roflumilast.
Tacrolimus	St. John's Wort may decrease the blood concentration of Tacrolimus. Monitor for changes in the therapeutic/toxic effects of Tacrolimus if St. John's Wort therapy is initiated, discontinued or altered.
Temsirolimus	St. John's Wort may increase the metabolism of Temsirolimus decreasing its efficacy. Concomitant therapy should be avoided.
Theophylline	St. John's Wort decreases the effect of theophylline
Tipranavir	St. John's Wort may decrease the concentration and efficacy of Tipranavir. Concomitant therapy should be avoided.
Tolvaptan	St. John's Wort is a CYP3A4 inducer and will decrease serum concentrations of tolvaptan and ultimately, its clinical effects.
Tramadol	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Tranylcypromine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Use caution during concomitant therapy and monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Trazodone	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Triazolam	St. John's Wort may decrease the effect of the benzodiazepine, triazolam.
Trimipramine	St. John's Wort may decrease serum concentrations of Trimipramine. Possible increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor for changes in Trimipramine efficacy and toxicity if St. John's Wort is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Ulipristal 	Concomitant therapy with strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma concentrations of ulipristal and ultimately its effectiveness. Avoid combination therapy.
Vandetanib	Decreases levels of vandetanib by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated.
Venlafaxine	Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Voriconazole	St. John's Wort may decrease the serum concentration of voriconazole by increasing its elimination. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Warfarin	St. John's Wort may decrease the serum concentration of warfarin by increasing its metabolism. Concomitant therapy should be avoided. Monitor for changes in the therapeutic and adverse effects of warfarin if St. John's Wort is initiated, discontinued or dose changed.
Zolmitriptan	Use of two serotonin modulators, such as zolmitriptan and St. John's Wort, increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Consider alternate therapy or monitor for serotonin syndrome during concomitant therapy.
