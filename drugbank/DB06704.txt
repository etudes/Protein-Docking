# AHFS_Codes:
Not Available

# ATC_Codes:
V09IX01

# Absorption:
Iobenguane rapidly clears from the blood and is highly retained in adrenergic tissues.

# Biotransformation:
Less than 10% of the dose is metabolized into m-iodohippuric acid (MIHA). However the mechanism in which this metabolite  is produced is unknown.

# Description:
Synthetic guanethidine derivative that locates phaeochromocytomas and neuroblastomas. The radioisotope used can either be iodine-123 for imaging or iodine-131 for destruction of tissues that metabolize noradrenaline. Iodine 123 is a cyclotron-produced radionuclide that decays to Te 123 by electron capture. Images are produced by a I123 MIBG scintigraphy. FDA approved on September 19, 2008.

# Dosage_Forms:
Injection, powder, for solution	Intravenous

# Drug_Category:
Diagnostic Agents
Radiopharmaceutical

# Drug_Interactions:
Amitriptyline	May diminish the therapeutic effect and increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result of Iobenguane as it inhibits noradrenaline transporter function
Cocaine	Sympathomimetic that increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result
Ephedrine	Sympathomimetic that increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result
Imipramine	May diminish the therapeutic effect and increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result of Iobenguane as it inhibits noradrenaline transporter function
Labetalol	May diminish the therapeutic effect and increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result of Iobenguane as it depletes or inhibit reuptake of noradrenaline stores
Milnacipran	Milnacipran decreases the effects of Iobenguane thus increases the risk of producing a false-negative result. May discontinue milnacipran for at least 5 half-live.
Phenylephrine	Sympathomimetic that increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result
Phenylpropanolamine	Sympathomimetic that increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result
Pseudoephedrine	Sympathomimetic that increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result
Reserpine	May diminish the therapeutic effect and increase chances of producing a false negative imaging result of Iobenguane as it depletes or inhibit reuptake of noradrenaline stores

# LIMS_Drug_ID:

# Mechanism_Of_Action:
Structure of iobenguane is similar to noradrenaline so it can be taken up by adrenergic tissue in the adrenal medulla, liver, heart, and spleen. Once taken up by noradrenaline transporters in the adrenergic nerve terminals, it is stored in the presynaptic storage vesicles. The radioactive iodine component is responsible for its imaging properties.
