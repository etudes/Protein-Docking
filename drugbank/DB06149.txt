# Absorption:
Teicoplanin is poorly absorbed after oral administration but is 90% bioavailable when administered intramuscularly.

# Biotransformation:
Two metabolites (metabolites 1 and 2; 2 to 3% of total teicoplanin) have been isolated after intravenous administration of radiolabeled teicoplanin. After purification, their structures were found to be new teicoplanin-like molecules, bearing 8-hydroxydecanoic and 9-hydroxydecanoic acyl moieties. This metabolic transformation is likely due to hydroxylation in the omega-2 and omega-1 positions for metabolites 1 and 2, respectively, of the C-10 linear side chain of component A2-3. This might explain the low extent of metabolism of teicoplanin if we consider that only component A2-3 has a linear chain that is susceptible to such oxidation.

# Description:
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic. It is a mixture of several compounds, five major (named teicoplanin A2-1 through A2-5) and four minor (named teicoplanin RS-1 through RS-4). All teicoplanins share a same glycopeptide core, termed teicoplanin A3-1, a fused ring structure to which two carbohydrates (mannose and N-acetylglucosamine) are attached. The major and minor components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety, Î²-D-glucosamine, and differ only by the length and conformation of a side chain attached to it. [Wikipedia]

# Pharmacology:
Teicoplanin is an antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. It is a glycopeptide antiobiotic extracted from <i>Actinoplanes teichomyceticus</i>, with a similar spectrum of activity to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Oral teicoplanin has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy to vancomycin.
