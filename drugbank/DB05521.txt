# AHFS_Codes:
8:18.40

# ATC_Codes:
J05AE11

# Absorption:
Telaprevir is orally available, most likely absorbed in the small intestine, with no evidence for absorption in the colon. Maximum plasma concentrations after a single dose of telaprevir are generally achieved after 4 to 5 hours. In vitro studies performed with human Caco-2 cells indicated that telaprevir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Exposure to telaprevir is higher during co-administration of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin than after administration of telaprevir alone. Dissolution of telaprevir is not dependent by pH.

# Biotransformation:
Telaprevir is extensively metabolized in the liver, involving hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction. Multiple metabolites were detected in feces, plasma, and urine. After repeated-oral administration, the R-diastereomer of telaprevir (30-fold less active), pyrazinoic acid, and a metabolite that underwent reduction at the Î±-ketoamide bond of telaprevir (not active) were found to be the predominant metabolites of telaprevir. In vitro studies using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms indicated that CYP3A4 was the major CYP isoform responsible for telaprevir metabolism. However, non-CYP mediated metabolism likely plays a role after multiple dosing of telaprevir.

# Description:
Telaprevir (VX-950) is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of the HCV NS3-4A serine protease. It is a member of a class of antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors and is the first hepatitis C drug that has demonstrated activity in patients who have failed prior therapy. On April 28, 2011, the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted 18-0 to recommend approval telaprevir for people with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and was approved in the U.S. in May, 2011.

# Drug_Interactions:
Alfuzosin	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Alprazolam	Telaprevir inhibits systemic metabolism of alprazolam and dose adjustment may be necessary.
Amlodipine	Telaprevir inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine and concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Atorvastatin	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Cisapride	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Clobetasol	Corticosteroids such as clobetasol may decrease the serum concentration of telaprevir. Telaprevir may increase the serum concentration of corticosteroids. Concurrent use of telaprevir and systemic corticosteroids is not recommended. When possible, consider alternatives, and if such a combination is necessary, use extra caution, monitoring patients for excessive systemic steroid effects as well as for diminished telaprevir effects.
Clocortolone	Corticosteroids such as clocortolone may decrease the serum concentration of telaprevir. Telaprevir may increase the serum concentration of Corticosteroids. Concurrent use of telaprevir and systemic corticosteroids is not recommended. When possible, consider alternatives, and if such a combination is necessary, use extra caution, monitoring patients for excessive systemic steroid effects as well as for diminished telaprevir effects.
Conivaptan	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Cyclosporine	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Must monitor levels closely with concomitant therapy.
Digoxin	Telaprevir is a substrate of p-glycoprotein and thus increases the AUC and Cmax of digoxin. This indicates an increased absorption of digoxin. Lowest dose of digoxin should be used first and levels be closely monitored.
Dihydroergotamine	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Efavirenz	Inducers of CYP3A enzymes will decrease telaprevir levels.
Ergotamine	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Escitalopram	Telaprevir decreases Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of escitalopram however the mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Concomitant therapy may call for dose adjustment.
Etravirine	Telaprevir, when used concomitantly with etravirine, may experience a decrease in serum concentration. It is recommended to monitor telaprevir therapy closely.
Ketoconazole	Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase exposure of telaprevir.
Lomitapide	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.
Lovastatin	Telaprevir increases levels by affecting CYP3A4 metabolism. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.

Ponatinib 	Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase levels of ponatinib. Monitor concomitant therapy closely.
Raltegravir	Telaprevir increases the exposure of raltegravir by up to 31%  but this interaction is considered as not clinically relevant.
Rifampin	Strong CYP3A4 inducers will decrease levels of telaprevir. Concomitant therapy is contraindicated.

# Toxicity:
The highest documented dose administered is 1875 mg every 8 hours for 4 days in healthy subjects with telaprevir alone. In that study, the following common adverse events were reported more frequently with the 1875 mg q8h regimen compared to the 750 mg q8h regimen: nausea, headache, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, and vomiting. The two most common adverse events that caused the discontinuation of treatment are anemia and rash.
